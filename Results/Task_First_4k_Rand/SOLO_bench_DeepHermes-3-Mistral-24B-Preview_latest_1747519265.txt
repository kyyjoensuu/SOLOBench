1. Identify the delimiters: Look for recurring characters or symbols in the text that can mark the start and end of each chunk. In this case, it appears the delimiter is the pipe symbol (|).
2. Extract the desired chunks: Write some code or use a programming environment to identify all occurrences of these delimiters, then pull out the text between them. Pay attention to whether you want full chunks including the delimiters or just the content in between.
3. Process the chunks as needed: Once extracted, chunks can be assigned to variables for further analysis or manipulation.
