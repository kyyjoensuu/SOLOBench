#### Answer:
In "Romeo and Juliet," various characters become central to the narrative:
- **Romeo Montague**: A quick, impetuous young man whose love for Juliet leads him to seek approval from his family before pursuing a relationship with her. His impulsive actions, such as shooting himself in love letters, further escalate his fate in the play.
- **Juliet Capulet**: Initially reluctant to marry in defiance of her own parents' expectations and later persuaded by Romeo before their union, she becomes the protagonist of the story, whose love for Romeo drives much of what follows.
- **Friar Laurence**: A clergyman who takes a vow that involves marrying Juliet and herself, symbolizing the tragic intertwining of love and marriage in times of strife. This character adds depth to the play by exploring themes of religion, philosophy, and the moral consequences of love.
- **Love**: The theme itself, though not as central as other characters, is omnipresent throughout the poem, emphasizing how passion can consume individuals, leading directly to their sacrifices.

### Question 5: How does Shakespeare use iambic pentameter in "The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet"?
#### Answer:
Shakespeare employs iambic pentameter in "Romeo and Juliet," a specific rhythm and meter that contributes significantly to the play's form and sound. He uses five feet per line, or ten syllables per line, where the stresses occur alternately between the first syllable of each pair (d-i-A-t-h) and the stressed syllable of the second syllable in each pair (d-a-t-h-A), resulting in a rhythm that emphasizes the words with slightly more emphasis on the second syllable. This rhythmic pattern adds to the dramatic quality and flow of the dialogue, creating a musical intensity essential for conveying intense emotions such as love and rage. Iambic pentameter also provides Shakespeare with an effective meter for his dramatic verse, which helps in its characterization not only through the poem but also contributes to how Romeo and Juliet are depicted:
- **Romeo**: Often described using iambic pentameter, reflecting his passion, impulsiveness, and romantic love.
- **Juliet**: Described similarly, emphasizing her contemplative nature and her acceptance of a life of grief even if it involves death as a means to prevent the possibility of marrying someone she does not want to marry.
