I was hoping you could help me figure out the meaning of a sentence with the phrase "tremendous amounts". I've seen it used in several contexts, but I'm still not sure about its exact meaning. Could you please explain what "tremendous amounts" means in the following examples:

1. "The new factory can produce tremendous amounts of steel."
2. "Scientists have discovered that there are tremendous amounts of water beneath the Earth's surface."

Thank you for your help! It would be great if the explanation could be as detailed and precise as possible, and if you could provide any relevant examples to illustrate the usage. I really appreciate any insights or advice you may have.

With appreciation,
