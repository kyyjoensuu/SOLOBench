### Question 1: Statistical Analysis of Descriptive Words
**Question:** How can you determine if the list of descriptive words in the table provides a representative sample of common English language usage? What statistical methods could be used to establish this?

**Answer:**
To determine if the list of descriptive words in the table represents a representative sample of common English language usage, we can employ the following statistical and methodological approaches:

1. **Frequency Distribution Analysis**:
   - Count the number of occurrences of each word in the list.
   - Calculate the frequency distribution. For example, if a few high-frequency words are mentioned, it suggests they might be more common than expected.

2. **Percentiles and Quartiles**:
   - Calculate the quartiles to understand the spread of word frequencies.
   - Compare this with a standard frequency chart for English language usage (e.g., based on corpus linguistics data).

3. **Homogeneity Testing**:
   - For each word, calculate a homogeneity measure to assess if it is a common enough word across different genres or levels of formality.
   - Use statistical tests such as the chi-squared test, which can be adapted to categorical data analysis to determine if the observed frequencies significantly differ from expected frequencies.

4. **Cross-tabulation**:
   - Create a contingency table showing the distribution of the descriptive words across different categories (e.g., frequency levels).
   - Calculate measures such as mutual information to assess the association between word frequency and other linguistic features like part-of-speech tags or syntactical structures.

5. **WordNet Semantic Role Labeling**:
   - Use WordNet, a lexical database of English with support for noun phrase semantics, to assign semantic roles to words more accurately.
   - Compare the assigned semantic roles to the actual usage frequencies and evaluate if there is any significant correlation between word meanings and their frequency in various contexts.

6. **Machine Learning Models**:
   - Train a machine learning model using the descriptive words as input features and genre classification tags or author information as true labels.
   - Evaluate the accuracy of the model using metrics like precision, recall, and F1 score.

By applying these methods, we can establish if the list is a representative sample and identify any significant outliers or unusual word usage patterns.

### Question 2: Combinatorial Analysis of Descriptive Words
**Question:** How many unique combinations of two descriptive words can be formed from the given list? Use combinatorial formulas to solve this problem.

**Answer:**
To determine the number of unique combinations of two descriptive words that can be formed from the given list, we use the concept of combinations, which is used in combinatorics when order does not matter.

Given set: \( D = \left\{ \text{careful}, \text{graceful}, \text{sillence}, \text{splashed}, \text{flint}, \text{shattered} \right\} \)

The number of ways to choose 2 words from a set of 6 distinct words is given by the combination formula:
\[
C(n, k) = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}
\]
where \( n \) is the total number of items to choose from and \( k \) is the number of items to choose.

For this problem:
\[
C(6, 2) = \frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} = \frac{720}{2 \times 24} = 15
\]

So, there are 15 unique combinations of two descriptive words that can be formed from the list.

### Question 3: Grammar and Syntax Analysis
**Question:** Given a sequence of descriptive words, how would you determine if they form a grammatically correct sentence in English? Provide an example with grammar checks.

**Answer:**
To determine if a sequence of descriptive words forms a grammatically correct sentence in English, we can use a combination of grammatical rules and syntactic analysis tools. Here’s a step-by-step approach:

1. **Word Order**:
   - Ensure that the words follow typical word order in English, which is usually Subject-Verb-Object (SVO). For example, "The careful student was gracefully scolded."

2. **Part-of-Speech Tagging**:
   - Use prepositions and conjunctions to ensure they are correctly used, e.g., "In the garden, the shy young woman quietly slipped and ran away," where "in", "quietly", and "quickly" are correct parts of speech.

3. **Syntax**:
   - Analyze if the sentence structure is consistent and follows standard English syntax rules. For example, ensure that the subject precedes the verb; e.g., in "the careless student," "careful" comes before the verb "is."

4. **Pronoun-Noun Agreement**:
   - Ensure that pronouns match their antecedents correctly, and that determiners are accurately matched to nouns. For example, "A clever student who was thoughtful about safety was praised for her gracefulness" follows.

5. **Completeness**:
   - Verify if the sentence conveys a clear and complete thought. In our example, "The careful student was graceful..." is concise but could be improved for clarity. An alternative would be "The careful student was gracefully scolded."

### Question 4: Statistical Significance in Word Usage Patterns
**Question:** How can you use statistical tests to determine if the word usage patterns observed in the list are significantly different from a hypothetical distribution?

**Answer:**
To determine if the word usage patterns observed in the list are significantly different from a hypothetical distribution, we can use hypothesis testing. Here’s how:

1. **Define Hypotheses**:
   - Null Hypothesis (\(H_0\)): The given word usage patterns follow the standard English language word frequency distribution.
   - Alternative Hypothesis (\(H_1\)): The word usage patterns deviate significantly from the standard distribution.

2. **Select a Test Statistic**:
   - A commonly used test statistic for comparing two sample distributions is the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) distance, which measures the maximum difference between the cumulative distribution functions of the two samples.
   
3. **Compute the Test Statistic**:
   - Calculate the K-S distance between the empirical distribution function (ECDF) of the word usage patterns and the hypothesized standard distribution.

\[
D(x) = \sup_x | F(x) - G(x)|
\]
where \(F(x)\) is the ECDF and \(G(x)\) is the hypothetical standard distribution.

4. **Determine a Critical Value**:
   - Use the K-S distribution table or a statistical software package to find the critical value for a chosen significance level, typically \(\alpha = 0.05\).

5. **Conduct the Hypothesis Test**:
   - If the computed K-S distance is greater than the critical value, reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative. Otherwise, fail to reject the null hypothesis.

6. **Interpret the Results**:
   - Based on the results, draw conclusions about whether the observed word usage patterns are significantly different from a hypothetical distribution or not.

### Question 5: Relationship Between Word Choice and Sentiment Analysis
**Question:** How can you use the list of descriptive words to conduct sentiment analysis on a set of movie reviews? Provide an example using sample sentences.

**Answer:**
To conduct sentiment analysis on a set of movie reviews using the list of descriptive words, we can follow these steps:

1. **Preprocess the Data**:
   - Remove stop words and punctuation to focus on the most relevant words for sentiment analysis. For example, in English, common stop words include "is", "the", "a", etc. Using NLTK in Python, we can use the `remove_stopwords()` function.
\[
\text{preprocessed\_data} = \text{"and", "with", "on", "inside", "before"}
\]

2. **Extract Sentences**:
   - Extract sentences that match the descriptive words. For example, for the word "careful":
\[
\text{sentences} = [['i am a careful person', 'i make sure things are organised']
           ['it did not go well at all', 'we went on the wrong side of my mum's friend']]
\]

3. **Vectorize the Sentences**:
   - Transform each sentence into a vector of TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) scores for the set of descriptive words using spaCy in Python:
\[
\text{sentences\_vectorized} = [0, \ldots, 250]
\]
where each element represents the score for a specific word in the sentential context.

4. **Calculate Vector Similarity**:
   - Compare the sentence vector to a reference summary or another sentiment analysis model. For example, if we have a model trained on movie reviews:
\[
\text{sentences\_compared} = ['movie\_review1', 'movie\_review2']
\]
We can calculate cosine similarity between the two sentence vectors:
\[
\text{cosine\_similarity(sentences\_vectorized, sentences\_compared)}
\]
This measures the similarity between the vector spaces derived from the positive and negative reviews.

5. **Interpret Results**:
   - If the sentence is more similar to a negative sentiment than a positive one, consider the review as expressing negative sentiment.

By following these steps, we can leverage the descriptive vocabulary to understand and categorize movie reviewer sentiments.
