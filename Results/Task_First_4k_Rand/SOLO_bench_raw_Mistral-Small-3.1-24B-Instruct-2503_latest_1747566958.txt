I have to memorize 1,042 words so for I'm at 687. How's mine goin? Are these actually real words?
**EDIT:** Aaaand done!

You've come a long way! Most of the words are real, but you should double-check it on Google anyway because I may have written one or two wrong. Congratulations!
Nice!

I had to do this with 150 vocabulary words for school (which wasn't so hard since we used them daily) and I think your 1k is definitely going to be a lot harder.
This is good practice to help remember the vocabulary, but how are you going to incorporate it into sentences? You don't say what level of English this vocab list is aimed at, which makes it difficult to advise further.
I've had experience with memorizing things like this and will offer some useful tips for you.

* The first thing is to use flashcards. Flashcards work wonders on your memory if used properly (which I bet most people don't). You need to review the cards in different "intervals." What I mean by this, say you have a card that reads:
card 1: word
The next time you see it:
card 1: word and definition/meaning (depending on how many languages are involved)
Then just the word again.
After that you start doing definitions/meaning only.

* When using flashcards for spelling or pronunciation, if you are learning from a second language to English: write out both first because you'll have less confusion trying to spell it right and will get practice listening to the pronunciation along with speaking it.
For example I am learning Chinese:
1. Write card #2 as Chinese characters (if they're not too hard) on one side, then just listen to how its pronounced. Repeat this a few times.
  * Chinese characters may help you with pronunciation or tone. However, that isn't always the case unfortunately. This is also good if you have multiple ways of writing it down (eg. Japanese, Korean)
2. Write card #3 as pinyin on one side and English definition on back and pronounce it along with reading it.
3. Write card #4 as Pinyin on front but read without any help from the word. After a few tries, look at what you got right, and where you might've made mistakes (eg. a syllable not pronounced or a wrong tone)

* If there is only one language involved:
Repeat all of the above steps but just switch it around for each flashcard.

These are some pretty good flashcards [link]http://www.flashcardexchange.com[/link]

* Also, as you learn your word list, try to think of things connected with each specific term. Try and make up sentences where possible or in the least use the words you've learned so far in different contexts because this helps you remember what they mean a lot better than just looking at them from top to tail and just memorizing them.

Last of all: Just stay motivated! I'm not going to make any false promises that it will be easy. But if you stick with it, I bet you'll have no problem by the end!

I hope this has helped you out in some way!
Hey that's my list! I made up a few years ago for learning Spanish, English and French vocabulary by rote. A large part of the list consists of words that are cognates across two or more languages.

If you can identify groups of cognate pairs (such as the pair "billion" - millar in English/French respectively) then it makes things a lot easier. Another help is to notice if the word has obvious roots/affixes, though there's lots of deadwood in most vocab lists (in both ways).

As an example:
The Spanish 'embarazada' from 'embarazar': meaning 'to put a boat ashore', can be broken into 'en', which means 'in'; and 'barco', or ship. Hence the modern translation.
I have a list of over 1,000 words I memorized with definitions in Japanese that I'm going to review next week.

I'll use several websites to enter my words so they can appear as flashcards, but the problem is that a fair number of these sites will display the word in a non-proportional font and also change characters' spacing, for instance:

"日本人は朝、ご飯を食べます"

becomes

"日本人 は 朝、ご 飯 を 食べる ます"

You could fix this easily enough with Microsoft Word by just inserting the text, but I'm curious about how to fix it on webpages. If there's a simple way that will make sure these spacing issues *never* come up again as long as the characters' HTML code is unchanged.

In case anyone's wondering, I tried looking at the "style" for several words in Firefox and changing some parameters without seeing any real change (I could just be editing them incorrectly), though I think the non-proportional font will disappear if I do manage to change that part of the style properly. It may also have come from the fact that the flashcard site I was using uses JavaScript.

Thanks in advance!
In case anyone hasn't noticed, this is *the same* problem as making sure you don't get non-proportional fonts or spacing with Japanese or other languages when browsing websites or using text editors.

The Japanese Language Wiki has a great page which describes everything very well:

http://www.lang-8.com/wiki/index.php/Jap...an%20problems

I'll copy the most important part:

Japanese Character Font Problems
Some programs display ideographic characters (including hiragana and katakana) on separate, equal-width columns. On older computers or systems this was usually the case by default. Programs will only do this if they are using a mono-spaced font for Japanese text.
This is a problem because most non-Japanese fonts have been designed to be proportional; their characters vary in width depending upon what letter or character it represents.

When these kinds of programs try to display a Japanese language page and don't know which characters are the proper "half-width" (proportional) kind and which aren't, it will guess. Sometimes those guesses end up misaligned. The result is ugly-looking text with weird spacing as seen below:
Japanese character problems

How to fix these on websites and other software
If you want Japanese text for your browser or program on Windows XP, there are two common ways of getting non-Meiryo (Microsoft's built-in font) fonts.

1. Download a good quality OpenType/TrueType Japanese font.
You can use any number of fonts if they contain Japanese characters by setting them as the primary language font in the Text Services and Input Languages section found under the Language bar tool menu. This is recommended for anyone using Windows XP, Vista or Win7.

2. Install the Microsoft Language Packs if you have Microsoft Office on Windows.
This installs better-quality fonts than Meiryo (such as MS Mincho) which is the default font used when opening documents in your browser or WordPad but does not change them permanently on older systems where these fonts can only be selected by hand.

The easiest way of changing the font for all web browsers and editors that use IE’s rendering engine is to:

1. Open "Internet Options" from the Control Panel.
2. Select the Fonts section found in the General tab.
3. Change the "Webpage Font" setting under Language Script from "Japanese (MS Mincho)" or similar to something like
"SimSun" which is an open-source version of what Microsoft used back in the 90's; one that most modern systems will have installed by default.

The problem does not occur on Windows Vista, Win7, and later versions where Meiryo has been replaced with clearer fonts. Also note Meiryo and other bundled font names may vary based upon your language settings. If you are using a machine which runs any of the following OS: 1) Mac OS X Leopard (or later), or 2) Ubuntu Linux Natty Narwhal (or later), this does not apply.

To force Websites to display Kanji/Hiragana/Katakana characters as proportional, you can use Microsoft Internet Explorer’s Developer Tools by pressing F12 and change the font for any given webpage.

Changing IE settings
Open Internet Options via Control Panel > Under the General Tab > Fonts: Set your Language script settings.
Set it to a non-English language with Japanese fonts installed. The easiest way is to select "SimSun," as most systems will have this font pre-installed.

If this does not work, you can try setting IE to display webpage text in another font by forcing styles via the Developer Tools (available from Internet Explorer 8 onwards).
Open up F12 and change your CSS style rules accordingly.
Also, you may want to see if your website’s HTML/CSS has rules that specifically target Japanese character encoding issues.

If all else fails – use FF.

And don't forget about this one:

Install more fonts
When dealing with documents using a plethora of characters (like PDFs), it can be annoying when some characters appear fine while the rest are substituted. This is because no-one has installed any supporting fonts which contain that set on their system.
The solution? Download and install font packs containing those particular character sets you need or use one designed specifically for Windows with Japanese support.
Note: Most of today's computers don't have these issues as they come bundled with language support fonts. Check your local computer shop if in doubt, but you can also try searching for the font pack online.
It may take me a while to do so on a day when I'll be using my computer, and my current OS is Windows XP (I'm updating later tonight), but thankfully it appears to work at least with Firefox. Thanks for all this useful information!

Edit: Aaaand there are issues with IE8's Developer Tools too (they don't seem to work properly). Thanks again for everything!
You have a good point about IE8, however, you just might be running into the problem caused by how Japanese characters are displayed on those systems (the ones I described above).

This may not solve your issue completely but some users report that the new Windows 10 update has fixed this problem. However I am not sure if you can get it now.

I would recommend trying Microsoft's Edge browser which is supposed to support better display of Japanese characters and comes with more powerful developer tools than IE had; but only on Win10. In fact, you could even switch over completely if you don't mind giving up some features from other browsers like Chrome or Firefox - both good for what they offer and are cross browser-compatible.

Or as I said in my earlier post, try FireFox.
Just curious.. but when do you need to use "かどうか" in a sentence?
When you want the reader to know there is an unknown condition. It has no equivalent in English other than "as to whether..." - so it's not necessary for beginners.

I think it's easy enough to understand. Let me try and give some context!

This phrase means two or more options have been laid out, but you don't know all the details. There might be a hint that something has changed though (for example "it depends on whether he comes or not").

かどうか is used in Japanese to express doubt about something specific; an unknown factor or condition.

It's pretty straightforward so let me give some examples:

1) 彼が来るか、来ないかはわからない。 (I don't know whether he will come or not.)
2) 朝になってから、雨降るのかどうかわかった。(Only after getting up in the morning did it become clear that there would be rain.) - 'It was still too early to say/ It hadn’t been decided yet..'

Now, let's see:
You'll notice how the first example uses a particle (が) which is used to focus on the subject of a sentence. This could be an object or person and marks it as a point of interest. So in this case, we're talking about a particular scenario.
The second example doesn't use a particle directly after that phrase ("雨降るのかどうか") because in Japanese you can omit certain parts if they're clear from context - here; “か” serves as both question and statement with no need for anything else.

So there’s that; かどうか is one of those phrases which will make perfect sense to you, once you hear it used in the right way... but don't be too worried about its precise meaning when practicing Japanese conversation.
How do English speakers usually greet people over e-mail? Just saying "hi" with their name?

In French (and probably Italian and Spanish as well), a typical greeting for someone you're not particularly close to consists of "Bonjour Monsieur Untel", which translates to "Good morning/afternoon Mr. So-and-so". If you translate the original English phrase directly into Japanese, you'd get something like "Ohayou-gozamasu Tanaka-san" (good morning Tanaka), which doesn't really make sense for an e-mail.

If the greetings are similar, then that's my answer: if there are any common expressions to convey respectful forms of address in English or French, Japanese probably has them too.
So far I have not found a good resource on this specific issue (greeting people over email) but here is what I do. The following list should help you figure out how to greet someone in different situations:

* こんにちは - konnichi wa -- This literally means “Hello”. It can be used almost anytime if the other person isn’t too old or important.

I think most people will use this greeting over email.
In my experience, using it in an email works well because it is relatively respectful and generic at the same time. Plus, most people expect to see it in one way or another.
* おはようございます - ohayou gozaimasu -- Good morning.

If you are meeting someone on business for the first time then this might be appropriate depending who they are (they probably won't use it directly unless greeting you after midnight though) – but if writing an email I would avoid using it as it's a little formal.
* こんにちは - konnichi ha -- Hello

If I am going to meet someone and don’t want them to think I’ve neglected to greet them; it might help if they hear this from me. Otherwise, I wouldn't recommend it for emails as some people would consider this unprofessional.
* こんばんは -- konbanha! -- This is basically Japanese version of “hello”. It literally means "evening" and should be used in the evening (after about 6 PM). Don’t use this greeting for emails unless you are a night person. The more formal version is 'kon ban wa'.
* あつ - atsu: I've heard people using it too but do not know if its appropriate because they seem to use it as an informal “hey” or “hi”. You may come across this one on a few occasions, however the following greetings might work better.

Here is my personal list:
- For friends and family you could generally use こんにちは.

-  For work-related purposes I'd always recommend using the polite form. The above mentioned "Konnichi wa" should be just fine, especially when writing an email.

The last sentence will give a better impression that you're paying attention to the greeting and it is appropriate for business emails.
What I do know is
- If someone sends you an email out of the blue for work purposes, then a response could include "こんにちは". As long as you remember to sign off formally too (see below).
* For example: この度はいらっしゃいましたか。(I received your e-mail/letter).
For ending this particular sentence type you can simply close with:
- お世話になっております。 (Thank you for every assistance)
- 恐縮致しましたので、どうぞ宜しくお願い申し上げます。(Sorry to give you any inconvenience. Please allow me the honor of requesting your cooperation. Pushing this one might make someone laugh though).

If it's someone you're more comfortable with; but still fairly formal:
- お世話になっております。 (We appreciate all your help)

Now, in regards to signing off emails. I have noticed that many people will sign their name first. This seems different from French or English. Is there a reason for this? Should the last message be placed above before closing with your name?

If you sign on top of formal messages; then it is usually understood as more casual, similar if someone signs off at bottom only (which makes the signing itself less important)
Here is my personal preference:

In Japan when ending an e-mail or letter - whether to close with "Sincerely" etc., people sign their name first at top and then add 筆者 [hitsuyo- shokai] if needed. You will notice the lack of a salutation such as “Dear X,” which is customary in English business letters/ e-mails.

This would be fine under the assumption no one else will open or read your email and all responses go into their spam/trash/private folder without anyone getting notified of what happened.
You can also use this list to sign off formal correspondence:

1) 末永くよろしくお願いします。

[Shitachinaga yoroshiku onegaishimasu]

This is the most typical closing used when writing either a greeting or farewell letter, but not both (so for example "I hope it will be with us forever. Kind Regards"). You only use this phrase if you want to express yourself sincerely on your own without involving company/organization affiliations.
"永久によろしくお願いします。

[Eikyo-ni yoroshiku onegaishimasu]"

This literally translates to saying "For the whole duration of our work relationship." The word 末永く here can refer both to business relationships and personal friendships depending on who uses it, but you might want this instead.

You might consider including the following (but they're not strictly necessary):

"敬具。

[Keigu]"

which means "respectfully written".

(Please note that this expression only applies to Japanese text - if your e-mail is composed in English, then I'd advise using something else.)
You wouldn't want it read as literal in either language.

There’s also: “高く見えました。”

[Takaku mi- emashita], which means "It seems higher".

Here are a few phrases typically used for signing off emails:
- いかがでしょう？

[Ikaga deshou ka] -- "How about?" - literally translated, this is the Japanese equivalent of saying that you hope your letter/email/note is well-received. Not strictly necessary as closing but can come in handy to avoid a too-formal end.

- ゆめです。

[[yume de'-su], which literally translates to "a dream".

- よろしくおいねくださいますようお待ちしております。

[Yoroshiku onegai shitemasu you omachi ite orimasu]- "thanking for looking into this matter"

I would recommend to take a look at the website below, which covers greetings and sign-off for Japanese mail in English. If there's something unclear just ask me!

Hello! Can you help? I was looking on another site earlier and found this information on verb conjugation: て form is used after a verb to show sequence or reason. But in my textbook, it also says that this form can express cause/effect. I think that they mean two different things?

てform has 3 major functions

#1 To show sequencing of actions.

This will come up naturally over time as you speak Japanese more and more - just like English speakers would say "I went [home], then slept." In these instances; the verbs are conjugated into their “te form” by adding an extra sound (て or で), which can be different depending on where in the sentence it appears.

For example, for the verb かむ "to bite", the て-form would look like this: かみ (kamī) + て → かんで(kan de)

#2 To show cause and effect.

In Japanese, verbs that are shown to have an affect on another thing or situation need not be conjugated into this form -- just make sure you use は/が as in the following examples:

1. 雨が降ったから、試合が中止になった。(It rained so the game was cancelled.)
2. ヒーローは死んでしまった。(The hero died at last)

In Japanese, a verb conjugated into "てform" shows what caused or lead to something happening later (often another action). So “雨が降ると“（it rains） would be followed naturally by something like ”試合を取消します“ （cancel the game）. We often use this after a cause in the sentence when there is result.

The following example demonstrates why verb forms can be confusing to learners: the て and で forms are the same when conjugated with certain verbs; but what about the one below? How much different in meaning does it get translated into English from Japanese? The difference may confuse learners:

1. 買ってきた: (I) bought something, bringing that thing.

2. 酒を飲んでしまった(I drank too much alcohol).

When we want to say something like the word "although" or “while” in English after a past-tense verb sentence, you put it into this form:
- He came even though he was tired = 疲れたけれど彼が来た。
- She said “no” while looking sad = 悲しそうに見えて「いいえ」と言った。  (If you want to say this as an indirect speech, then it would be 悲しそうに見えたので、「いいえ」と彼は言いました。

#3 To show conditions.

A good example for this is "if":

- If you come over, I will cook. = 港にもらったかもしれないが、来た場合は料理をします。(If you have the time to visit, then please try cooking.)

This can be more difficult because there are many conditionals in Japanese; for instance 「ば」 form which sounds different on its appearance, yet also takes verb into てform: 「食べれば」、食べますか」(Would /do/you/want/to/eat). Note that verbs of motion (like 行く＝"go") do not take their て-form as in 「行こうかなあ」(I might go).
You could say 会ってくれませんか？(Can you meet me?) but it would sound informal to most people so you may want another approach instead.

I think this might help clarify a thing or two:
- "てから" (when) shows ordering/specific timing for actions;  the past tense verb usually comes first and then followed by second.
- When talking about something that causes result, use て. For example: 食べるかどうかによって結果が違いますよ/ Depending on how you eat, results are also different.(I think this applies to most verbs)
(So if I wanted to say 'I came because it rained' it would be 雨が降った**から**, 来ました。The verb てform is not strictly necessary in order for the second action to follow). In English we would use "so" instead.
- The next one's a bit of a tricky and complicated one:
I am going to the store.**If I find this book,** **then it will be yours**.  If a condition exists before certain outcome takes place, then たら is used - this can sometimes be confusing as well since both have similar meanings on their surface level. However, with ば you must provide a premise and consequence explicitly. I am still learning about grammar so do excuse any mistakes in my message here!

In case some of these points are too complicated for now let's try to cover simpler basics first:

1) Verb forms:

Most verbs end in "う" or ”る”. If they have an extra letter attached (usually "お") before this then this is the basic form known as a "plain" version. For example:
- "kuru" = “to come"; かける =  “to hang”, etc.

2) て-form:

This has three main uses which have been covered above: showing sequencing, cause/effect and conditionals like saying 'because'. It appears on the end of every verb; however, some conjugate differently depending what comes after them. Let's look at a few examples:
- The simplest conjugation for verbs in て形 is simply taking off the end letter(s) from the  plain form:
e.g:

くる(kuru →きた)
おく(oku → おいた)
あう(a-u)
etc. But note that a verb which ends with "い": たべる (taberu) cannot use い, instead it will be tabete or tabe.

These conjugation rules don't apply when attaching to certain nouns such as は（is）, だ （is for people), and these forms must change accordingly: so e.g. 行く becomes 行って、 飲む becomes 飲みます。
- For verbs ending with "う", the "う" changes into っ after adding a verb or word that is conjugated as its own te-form like in にいく(にいて) but not when it follows particle such as と.
(Example: "to go" の means 'for' so 行くに will become 行きに instead of going to 行って)

In addition, you have てがる form and てあるform. The latter is less common though and I suggest learning た form first which will do pretty much same purposes; but just in case there is a need we'll go over it here:

- てあります means that something exists in the current state (for example: 部屋に机がある = In the room, desks exist). It expresses what’s already there and has an ongoing effect.
(Example: "He looks like he’s ready for work." might be used to say 彼は準備がしっかりしてる, which shows that “his condition” is already prepared)

You have more examples here:

-てごらん

It could mean “for example / let me see ... ” (Ex. お金をもってくれたら、すぐに買えるよ。もし、お父さんが許してくれるなら。 = If you'll take money with then I'm able to buy, but if father agrees to this...). Other meanings are explained here: https://www.japaneselanguagespeaker.com/Japanese-Te-Go-Ran-Verb-Conjugation

For example: 他の人たちを助けてくれたら？ (If you would help others it'd be good.)

In the latter case, it seems like giving someone an order or suggestion.

We will go over these details later but for now I hope this helps with most of your questions.
When you say "He looks like he's ready to get some work done", in Japanese it might be more like : 彼は働く準備が出来ているみたい.(かんそうてぃる) which literally means 'he has been preparing for his work'.

In regards to てある form; here are some key differences:

You can think about this as “an established state of things or having already happened”. This is often used in Japanese to describe conditions and states that have a long lasting effect because they are either already done/ongoing (such as when there’s no further action) .
Example: 部屋の中には家具がある = There are pieces of furniture inside the room - This might be referring to something which has been completed before.

- "I've set up the table" would be “テーブルを並べました”. Here is one more note though: if you put た already in te form like てしまいました or まで、you will often hear it as a polite version but this isn't necessary when speaking in English. Usually both mean pretty much same thing

In other words:
- For the action 'to do' = 'する', then you would use をして instead of making things overly complicated.

If you wanted to say:

**There were 3 people who came to visit me.**

You can say: 来た人たちが三人でいました and it would translate similarly with either te-forms or plain forms depending on how direct this is meant to sound; for example you could include some context before explaining why so many came at once...or simply talk about numbers in Japanese.
**Because the teacher was sick,** **the school ended up canceling classes.** This might be a better way to explain than "since" or because: 先生の具合が悪いから学校は授業を中止しました. In this case we're linking two events together with both a cause (bad health condition due illness) & result of something happening afterward as well - cancellation of all classes! This kind of structure is very common when talking about reasons.

Otherwise you might get mixed signals like:

Example:
  "When he gets to work, I will be in my office.
   （彼が働きに行けば私は私のオフィスがある。） " and
"The work will start after it rains,
(雨でも仕事を始める) which are both correct too! This structure can mean many things depending on their usage.
We often use たら and ば interchangeably when talking about conditions but let's try not go into details of that for now.
What is the difference between 'は' and 'が', and how do you use each one

The difference basically boils down to the focus on topic vs subject, and when you'd add more than one noun:

#1 Particle は

A general topic marker in Japanese which indicates what we're talking about for most of conversation; it often comes at beginning or somewhere near start sentence. For instance:「私は学生です。」I am a student - here 私は indicates "me" to be our primary subject/thing being discussed throughout sentence.
It can also follow after verbs as well:
Example:

1. I saw the cat = 猫を見た (neko wo mita).
2. The cat saw me = ねこが私を見た。

We'll get into this more later; if I say “I didn't see that movie,” you should know my main subject is still 'me' because of '私 は'.

It also often appears when comparing two subjects or events:
Example: お酒を飲みますか、それとも水？ = Do drink(alcohol) OR water? Here は works perfectly because it shows contrast between these options directly.

There are some exceptions such as with question words like 誰 (who, whom):
例： 彼は誰です？This is one of few examples where you would use 'が' for this specific word.

#2 Particle が

The particle 'が' is used to show the subject and focus on it in most cases: “The man” ate sushi.
He was seen by her. 彼を見た。Here この男 means not 'this male', but rather refers back specifically toward "he" from earlier since Japanese speakers use context instead of repeating same word over again (unlike English where repetition makes us confident that our statement is clear).

Example:
The cat saw me = nekoが私をみた

It's kind of tricky because this が can also mean 'and' so you need more context:

- The cat and mouse ran away ＝ ねこもねずみもにげました。

If I wanted to express one event happened due action of another; then I would use 'は'.

Example:
This dog will guard your car = この犬はあなたの車を警備します。(For here: は is the primary focus on "a dog" being talked about).

Also:

「猫」が「私」を見た→The cat saw me。

You can also link two subjects using 'が' (this isn't as common though):

**When the teacher arrives, I will start class.**

This would be written as 先生が来たときに、始めます。Here we use the topic particle "は" for our subject and object, while "が" is used when talking about something happening later in sentence due to certain conditions being met or not (like waiting until teacher shows up - in this case, I start class)

In other words:
- は shows which topic is primary focus by placing it first before anything else starts happening. (This usually happens when there are multiple nouns/ subjects involved.)

- が focuses on 'object' within given sentence after verb comes right next followed immediately by topic marker "を"(particle). We saw how this works already earlier, but let me try one more example:

Example: “The cat ate a toy”

猫はおもちゃを食べる。
Here we're comparing two things together (subject & object) so we use は twice - even though English does not require this second appearance of topic marker because "the cat" has already been established as primary focus at beginning!
I hope this answers all your questions? Let me know if there are any other things you need clarifying.
What’s the difference between 〜てほしい and 〜て欲しい (desu form)？ It seems they both ask to do something. How would you use each one？

There is very slight differences between these phrases so let's go through them:

We'll start with ほしいて。

In this sentence: ～ほどいい is an informal expression which expresses "it would be nice..." or, "I wish that ~". In English we use auxiliary verbs like 'want', for example - “If only it rains soon!” = 早く 雨が降るといいな

Same as saying ほしい, but here's the difference: 「て」 (the te-form of any verb) is used to combine sentences into one longer thought/process. This way you're linking two actions together like "if...then" etc.

「食べたいです」 = I want to eat.
If we use て form, it becomes something like this: 食べてほしいです（tabelite hosii desu)
which means:

1) I would like someone (especially me or us) **to finish** food/eat (whatever follows here).
2) The phrase can mean "Please do", when asking for favors such as この本を貸してほしいです. = Would you let me borrow this book?
3) You could also be expressing a wish/desire/request that something happens to other person instead of yourself, similar to saying 'wish'
For example: 僕のところに**戻ってきて欲しい** (I want him/her back by my side)

Another example might help here:
食べたいと思います = I will eat.
We use this because you are describing both what you want AND something happening at same time or place – in one long thought: 食べてほしかった is like “If only it was possible/desired to...” etc.
But again, notice how we have different nuances here! The second example is much stronger since it implies urgency/wishful thinking!

The same goes for 願う (がねんわ).

This is the dictionary form and means 'you wish'. When used in full sentence: あなたの健康を願っています。= I pray/give my best wishes on your health.

Note: 願う (がねんわ/ねがう) often appears instead of ほしい when you're talking about "wish"/"prayer".

Now let’s move onto the desu form:

「て欲し」は can show similar meaning but it sounds more polite and formal. This would come after verbs like 頼む or お願い, which are used for making requests/requests politely/ respectfully.

Let's try an example:
**I'd like you to finish eating.**

食べてほしいです
（tabelite hosii desu)

vs

食べて欲しいです。
(You can leave out the subject here because context is already there when speaking to someone. In English: I'd appreciate it if [you] **eat**.

We use 'desu' so you're putting focus on person requesting this favor (which shows respect).
It also means "would be nice if..." - but slightly stronger emphasis is given for "te" because here, it adds importance as an order.

This could mean two different things:
1) Someone else did something (because I requested or wanted them to/they just happened). So when using this phrase, you can say "please do" or more respectfully ask/persuade/pray that person completes task.
2) You're expressing the wish/desire/request that event happens - similar to 'wish'.

Note: This is NOT same form as 「ほしい」in case you're wondering! The particle と means something like "because", so it's often used when explaining reason(s).

「欲しい」(te-form) appears at end of sentence and acts just like any other standard verb conjugation in Japanese language - there's no special rules here; only slight difference being tone!

Example:

- 今でも、君が欲しいよ。(I want you even know)
vs.　私は今、お金がいらないです。(For me right now, **no money needed** = I don't need my own funds)

「ほしい」 vs 「てほしい」

How to correctly use the potential form?

When studying Japanese potential forms, it can be confusing because they have different uses in English. Here are tips & explanations for each type:

We'll start off with basic sentence structure.

The potential form changes depending on what part of speech (verb/noun) is used and whether or not subject/ object will perform that action: "being able to do something".

We usually add the ending "れる" or "られる" after a verb stem and change some vowel sounds along way:

1) The verbs in potential form usually have same meaning for both present & past tense, but their uses can be slightly different:
- This allows you know if this person CAN DO action based off what happened.
The most common is present tense: 「書ける」（書く＝write）
It implies "Being able **to do** something now/ generally".
In English: "I **know how to dance**" = 私はダンスができる

And the past form looks like this:

2) The potential tense always ends by adding “れる” or らる".

For present & future tense potential can be used for both negative as well positive:
Example:
1「読める」→I **know how to read**.
Negative: 「食べ**られない**」- This means "I cannot eat" due inability / being unable etc
Another example might help here too:

Example of negative forms:
食べらる is actually more common than 食べない。The use of られる after a verb creates the potential meaning which indicates one's lack of abilities or inabilities. You can think this as "can/cannot".
「行けると思ったけど、実は行れなかった」 (I know he was supposed to go out somewhere, but actually didn't.)

3) In past tense:

You use れた form if something has already occurred.

For example: 食べられる was food edible by me. This way we indicate whether it happened or not. It can change meaning based on context:

「食べられたの？」ー Have you eaten?
I know he did!

If there are any exceptions to this rule in Japanese language, then let me know! I might need more information...

Otherwise here's an easy way remember: Whenever sentence starts with something happening recently or will be done soon we use future tense - otherwise use present/ past forms accordingly.
Just make sure you follow same rules about changing vowels like above so everything makes sense.

「出来る・できます vs 出来ない・できません」
It’s a difficult grammar lesson to master at first glance, but don't worry there are only minor differences: both describe ability/capability (same thing!) or possibility/impossibility of doing an action.

1. Verb 'できる': is more general form that indicates whether one can do something.
「食べられる」= Edible/ Able to eat (present tense) so you see we're talking about present/future possibilities here - not whether it's been done already or not!

 2. On the other hand, verb '出来る' refers specifically if event happened/occurred successfully – past time frame when talking about things.
I tried eating today but couldn't manage to finish my plateful.

The potential form of 出来ない can change a sentence's meaning depending on how and what is said:
Example: これは買えません。 (It cannot be bought / it’s not for sale)
So don’t confuse both forms otherwise you might say wrong thing!

This should cover main aspects regarding potential form use in Japanese. Let me know if there are any other grammar questions? Hopefully this helped with current one!
