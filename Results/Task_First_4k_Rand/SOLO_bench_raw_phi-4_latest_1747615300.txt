To calculate the difference between the longest word and the 30th longest in the list, we first need to determine their lengths.

1. **Longest Word:**
   - The longest word in the provided list is "interact" with a length of 9 characters.

2. **30th Longest Word:**
   - We must sort all unique words by length and find the 30th longest.
   - Here are the lengths for a few of the longest words for context:

     | Rank | Word        | Length |
     | ---- | ----------- | ------ |
     | 1    | interact    | 9      |
     | ...  | ...         | ...    |
     | 28   | cooperation | 12     |
     | 29   | technology  | 10     |
     | 30   | discussion  | 11     |

3. **Calculate the Difference:**
   - The longest word has a length of 9.
   - The 30th longest word "discussion" has a length of 11.

4. **Difference Calculation:**
   \[
   \text{Difference} = 11 - 9 = 2
   \]

Therefore, the difference between the number of letters in the longest word and the number in the 30th-longest word is 2.
