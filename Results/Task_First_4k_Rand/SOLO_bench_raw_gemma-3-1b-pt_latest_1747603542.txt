<strong>Uncomfortable</strong> is one of the longest verses ever written by the 9<sup>th</sup> century Arabic poet and writer <strong>Al-Mutanabbī</strong> , which was completed in <strong>673 CE</strong>. The work is the ninth verse of an extensive poem consisting of ten such verses. The poem begins as follows:

وَمَا أَسْأَلُهُمْ مُرْشِدًا <strong>[1]</strong> ، وَمَا كِرَارٌ <strong>[2]</strong>،
وَمَا يُطْكِرُونَ ثِيَابَهُمْ <strong>[3]</strong>،
وَمَا يَزِرُّهُم مِّن مُّجَانِبَةٍ <strong>[4]</strong>،
يَا أَيُّهَا التَّامُّو <strong>[5]</strong>نُونٌ وَتَامٌّ <strong>[6]</strong>،
مُعَارِبُونَ <strong>[7]</strong>، وَحُمْرَةٌ <strong>[8]</strong>، وَحُمْرَةٌ <strong>[9]</strong>،
وَلَمْ يَكُ مُنْقِسًا فَسْوَارًا بَيْنَ <strong>[10]</strong>خَيلِهِمُ <strong>[11]</strong>


<strong>[ترجمة بالعربية]

</strong>

<strong>وما سألهُُم من رحمة، وما كاريءٌ</strong>
<strong>وما يكرُّونه ثيابهمِ، وما يزِرُّهمُ من مّنىٌ</strong>
<strong>يا أيها التَّمامُّونَنُونٌ وَتَامٌٌّ مُعَارِبونَ</strong>
<strong>وحمرةٌ وحمرةٌ، ولقد لم يمنّسهم من نقّاصٍ</strong>
<strong>في سَوْرٍ من خَيْلِهم!</strong>
