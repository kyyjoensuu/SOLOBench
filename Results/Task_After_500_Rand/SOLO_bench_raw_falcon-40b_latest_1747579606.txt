There are many possible solutions to this task, but I find the following solution easy to remember:
â€¢ Write a loop that creates a sentence (verb + adjective + noun + noun) in the first iteration. Then iterate again making the same kind of sentence but in the second iteration, pick the second-to-last word from your sentence in iteration 1 and make it an adjective so that you make a sentence from something like "sink green apple red". Repeat the process again. The nth iteration should pick the n-before-last word and so on until you have a single n-gram of length 200, where each word in the n-gram is randomly selected from the wordlist given.
The most obvious solution I can think of is to first create a list of all possible 4-words sentences that can be made from the given vocabulary list. I do this since we are only allowed to use each word once and not re-use. Then we just return one of the n-grams randomly without replacing any of the words in each n-gram. In effect you are going to return n sentences where n is 200 (the number of submissions we are required to make), so be prepared for the execution to take a while if you only have a minute to complete this exercise.
I had been planning to use the solution above, but was surprised to discover that it is actually too slow to be used in real-world applications. The next approach is a much better one and the one the authors use. The trick to use here is to use Python's random functionality to return one of the items in your array randomly from a given range. This would be impossible to do on an array of arbitrary length but here one of the bounds of the random function call is the size of the list so we know that the item selected will always be in the bounds of the original wordlist.
To find the length of all sub-sequences of random word combinations that give us a result of four, we simply use Python's range() function which accepts two parameters. The first parameter specifies the starting place for range() and we set it as 0 with the second parameter specifying the end of what range() should return us which we get from iterating through all words from an empty list.
Let's say you want to write a generator function that produces the values 0,1,2,3, then you can do the following to produce a list of all the values
def produce_values():
return values_list
produce_values()
If you now invoke the function produce_values() you will receive a value and to get to all the values you simply iterate over produce_values(), and this is exactly the same idea behind range().
The actual code to achieve n-grams of length n looks like this:
# returns a list of only the words in the vocabulary
def get_words():
return word_list
# get the 1-grams
one_gram_list = get_words()
# remove all word-repetitions to only have unique 1-grams words
one_gram_list = list(set(one_gram_list))
# return all 1-grams in a single list
return one_gram_list
# get all 2-grams that can be created from an n-sized sample (n: number of iterations)
def produce_grams(n):
# return all the 2-grams
get_words[pos:]) # return all 2-word combinations
grams = get_words()
grams.sort() # sort and return one_grams
return gram_list
# return 3-grams for an n-sized sample
def produce_grams(n):
get_words[pos1+1:pos2+1]) # return 3-word combination
grams.append(get_words(
grams.sort() # sort and return one gram list
def produce_grams(n):
return one_gram_list
# get all n-grams
return gram_list
# produce the n-grams
# return only a sample of the output (as required by the challenge)
produce(n)):
gram_list
grams.sort()
This last piece of code is to remove the first item from the final list, as we are required
