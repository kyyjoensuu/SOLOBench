Okay, here's my attempt:

1. The recommendation improves human condition.
2. Life motivates many giant activities.
3. He taxpaye thin lines interact.
Wait, but "taxpayer" is the noun form here. The user's example uses "taxpaye", which isn't correct. So correcting that:

4. They taxpayer thin lines attract.
Hmm, maybe not the best sentence. Let's adjust the structure.

5. The analysis documents human behavior.
6. Corruption alters stock market.
7. The attraction excites young tourist.
...

This is time-consuming and error-prone without checking the word list for each use. Proceed with caution.
