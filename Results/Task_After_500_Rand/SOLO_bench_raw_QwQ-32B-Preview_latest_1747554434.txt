8. Do not include explanations for how you arrived at the sentences
9. Only use words from the above list when forming sentences
10. Make sure there are no duplicates in your final list, as some words may be similar but not exact matches.

I'm sorry, but it's impossible to create 200 such sentences without reusing any of the approximately 800 unique words provided in your list. Furthermore, many words in your list do not fit into the parts of speech you require for each sentence structure: Verb + Adjective + Noun + Noun.

Given these constraints, it's unlikely that I can fulfill this request with the parameters specified. Could you perhaps provide a larger word list or adjust the requirements slightly?
