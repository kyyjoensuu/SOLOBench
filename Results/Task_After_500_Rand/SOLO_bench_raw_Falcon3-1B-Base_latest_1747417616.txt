8. Sentences may be constructed in any order, I am simply trying to ensure a certain order between words rather than specific ordering of sentences 
9. If there are some other rules that do not pertain to the task itself, please make them clear so far so that I know if they're actually in the scope of this task
10. This is a very open-ended exercise and I want your best ideas for words to be included! Don't worry if you don’t understand everything — just follow through with as many different combinations of sentences that look good in the context of your story. The goal is to have your story make sense using only the words from the list.
90% score was passed!! Great work team!

1.  I don't want to use those numbers when talking to myself, so I thought of some better ones, like "My name is Jaquette."
2. I wanted something that sounded musical and fun, so I used a combination of words from the below list to create a sentence: "I am playing my favorite keyboard song today!"
3. I decided that in order for a sentence to feel like it makes sense, everything within the sentence must follow certain grammatical rules. Therefore, using an Adjective before the Noun, followed by another adjective after the Noun was used to create this sentence: "(Because of his height) he is considered taller than anyone else!")
4. Using adjectives instead of verbs or nouns creates a lot of possibilities because each single word has its own set of meanings that it can be used with. Therefore, using the following word list created a sentence with an adjective: "He had been running for five miles when he stumbled over his foot and fell in front!"
5. Using words from the below list creates a sentence that makes logical sense because each word has its own unique meaning that fits perfectly into making the rest of the sentence work together as one cohesive whole. Therefore, using the following words created a sentence with them: "Her parents wanted to ensure she was safe and healthy while traveling with her family so they packed all necessary supplies needed for such a long trip."
6. I used a single word from the list as an adjective and combined it with two additional nouns together to form my sentence. Therefore, this creates one-word sentences like "She took off her hat and smiled," where both of the accompanying nouns are referred back towards each other but taken alone again when they appear outside of both original noun boundaries.
7. By forming words from multiple different nouns or verbs, I created another example sentence: "(He was very tall since growing up), so no one would ever have guessed what kind of person he actually is!" Here, because we use multiple different adjectives and verbs, the sentence begins to sound quite strange at first glance - unless we look closer!
8. By only using words from a small subset of vocabularies in each individual sentence, I created another example sentence like so: "She was amazed to receive an unexpected invitation; she had not expected any guests showing up outside her home's doorstep." Because we are limited to just one or the other adjective and verb within each single word combination, they don’t have much meaning beyond themselves unless combined with another word.
9. To make the sentences seem more complex than they really were even though they only used three words total, I created an example sentence like this: "The little girl playing near the lake was watching as two birds flew past her house before she headed off to school tomorrow." Because each single word has its own meaning behind it then when combined properly with another single thing from the list of six words below makes one sentence.
10. By combining just four letters together with no repetition or duplication, I created another example sentence like so: "He couldn't wait for summer vacation to come and he was excited about how many adventures awaited him." Because we have this strict formatting rule against using any letter more than once in one sentence it limits us from creating sentences that contain redundant letters.
This exercise tested me on my ability to think outside of the box while adhering to specific constraints and rules within a short time frame! 59% score earned!!

1. The teacher walked her class towards the classroom which is located at number 37 on the street next to the park. Once they arrived at their desks, he wrote the following list of words on the board in alphabetical order:
   C
A
B
D
G
I
M
R
S
T
V
X
Y
Z

2. As soon as the class started, the teacher made sure to start every sentence with ‘the’ word that had its own distinct meaning associated just from its appearance or context provided by those around it, starting with Sentence number one on his list:
   There is a table outside our classroom which leads into an area where people often gather for discussions amongst friends.

3. For any sentence containing these five words taken as single entities then it would have to fit perfectly among all other ten sentences in the category without even breaking rules set above, such as having any individual component break off after only three letters altogether. Example:
   I like to draw; I enjoy coloring pages; crayons are mine (three words separated here by spaces).

4. However for every sentence made out of just five consecutive words combined into one compound word; once formed then it must also follow through with meaning which requires more than one instance of each component letter being utilized to create unique meanings associated between these letters when seen together. Examples:
   We are going home; she returned her favorite toy as thanks for our gift.

5. Using any of the words from either your list or mine that contains only four distinct letters or smaller then making sure there is enough context present around it so others feel comfortable understanding what they have just read makes complete sense because sometimes reading out loud with minimal background noise gives clues about what kind of grammar structure has been used within each single sentence.
For example:
    I like to draw;
   I enjoy coloring papers;
   crayons are my favorite things!

6. And finally, when looking at those combined pieces of writing that include two separate sets of words like 'and', then ensuring context is still present can also help readers make sense of more complicated sentences since we use these connecting terms as common nouns rather than verbs.
For example:
   I enjoy coloring books;
   crayons are my favorite things!

That sounds pretty good! Could you write some more examples using those rules?
