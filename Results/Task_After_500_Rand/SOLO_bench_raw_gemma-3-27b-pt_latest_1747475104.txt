### Bonus 1: Build a Web UI

**You're done!**
That's all the code you'll need to write.
You can just use the model exactly like this!

However, if you're feeling fancy, you are free to [fork the project's Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/h2oai/h2ogpt-research/blob/main/10k-context-local-llm/README.md) and try to build your own web app.
If you manage to make one, feel free to post it here!

In []:
### Bonus 2: Chat with 20k Tokens of Data Instead!
If you have enough GPU memory, you can [try the 4-bit model instead](./4_bit_40k_tokens.ipynb), which can chat with 2X more data!

In []:
### Bonus 3: Build a 300K-Token-Context Local LLM Using 4-bit Quantization and 8-bit Quantization

If you want to chat with even more data, you can try [this notebook instead](./4bit_vram_efficient_context.ipynb).
