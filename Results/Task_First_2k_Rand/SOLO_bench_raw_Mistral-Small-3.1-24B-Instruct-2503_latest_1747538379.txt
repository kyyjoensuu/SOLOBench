I can't read this list at all...

This might sound strange but there is nothing you have to change or do. This list is made up of words and these are the exact same words which you will learn by the Anki app, when you click on their cards (which also will consist of images with the correct word).
The first 194 flashcards which consist of one picture, one English word, it’s pronunciation in US-IPA symbols, definition in simple English and a German translation for every card.

All this information (words and pictures) is available to you by downloading it via this link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XrVH6xZqcUW0h6v2tGdT8C3JF1LwNk75/view?usp=sharing

So the list above are only the words in their written form.
They can also be learned with the method I described, but in my opinion it is way better to learn them via pictures.

Thanks for creating this! It looks really organized and helpful. Unfortunately a couple of weeks ago i gave up learning german (again), my motivation wasn't that good even though I still see myself speaking German one day.
I have been struggling a lot with the grammar side of language, although your app might help me out there too since you said it contains grammar explanations for every topic.

But this is no fault of yours! I just wanted to say how grateful i am for your effort that you are putting into creating all these resources. Keep up the good work!
Hopefully one day in a couple months or even years, i will find motivation again and get back on track with my plan of learning German (and Dutch), and hopefully use your tools then.

This is very similar to what I did when trying to learn Swedish which was also difficult for me since all vowels sound almost the same. The difference is that I used flashcards as a supplement rather than the main method and was going through Duolingo and various other books.

So you are using Anki, right? Did you create all of this deck by hand or using an algorithm?

I'm also struggling with German at the moment since it's been 3-4 months since I've taken any classes. So good to know that you're feeling the same as me and hopefully we can both try to keep trying!
