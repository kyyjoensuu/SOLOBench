*   **Overlapping Categories:** Many words could fit into multiple categories.  For example, "justice" is an abstract noun but relates to legal actions (and could have a legal-related word category).

Would you like me to focus on a specific category, or perhaps analyze the words based on a particular theme (e.g., words related to communication, words related to nature, etc.)?
