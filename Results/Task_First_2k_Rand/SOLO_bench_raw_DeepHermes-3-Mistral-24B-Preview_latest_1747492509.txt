The word "moreover" is typically used in writing to introduce additional information that supports or strengthens the point being made. It signals to the reader that what follows will add further weight to the argument, idea, or explanation.

In terms of usage:

1) Use it when you want to emphasize an argument with more evidence: "Studying has been shown to improve academic performance; moreover, it also fosters discipline and time management skills."

2) Use it to introduce a crucial point that strengthens your case: "The new policy addresses major social injustices; moreover, its implementation is cost-effective over the long term."
3) Use it when building upon an existing line of reasoning by adding complementary information: "She excelled academically, having graduated top of her class in high school; moreover, she demonstrated exceptional leadership skills throughout her career."

However, avoid overusing "moreover" as overreliance on transition words can make writing seem forced. Use it sparingly when introducing particularly impactful additional points.

The word "thereby" is used to indicate the result of an action mentioned earlier in a sentence. It signals cause-and-effect and shows how one thing directly leads to another.

For example:
1) Studying consistently at night improved his test scores; thereby, he was able to maintain good grades over time with less overall study effort.
2) She invested heavily in employee training programs; thereby, workforce productivity increased by nearly 30% the following year.

In these cases "thereby" succinctly demonstrates how taking an action (studying consistently, investing in training) directly produced the stated outcome (higher test scores, greater productivity).

Again though, use "thereby" purposefully - not every cause-effect relationship needs it. When you see a direct connection with major implications for your writing's point, "thereby" can elegantly show that relationship.

In summary:
- Use "moreover" to add further persuasive weight to a sentence by introducing strong supporting information.
- Use "thereby" to clearly indicate how an action mentioned earlier directly produces its effect or result.

Let me know if this explains the meanings and uses of these words clearly enough. I'm happy to elaborate further as needed.
