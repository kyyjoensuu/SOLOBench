1. We first define a list of 200 sample sentences (replace these with your actual sentences).
2. Create a DataFrame using pandas with two columns: 'text' for the sentences and 'label' where each entry is labeled as 'opinion/sentence'.
3. Finally, save the DataFrame to a CSV file named 'sentences_dataset.csv'.
