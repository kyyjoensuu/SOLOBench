It seems there was a misunderstanding regarding the content provided. The extract you shared appears to be a list of words and phrases, possibly related to a crossword puzzle or a game like Scrabble. However, without a specific context or theme, it's challenging to create math-related questions based on this content. Instead, I can suggest some hypothetical math problems or puzzles that might involve the provided list of terms.

### Hypothetical Math Problems

1. **Word Frequency**:
   - **Question**: How many times does the word "defeated" appear in the given extract?
   - **Answer**: The word "defeated" appears once in the extract.

2. **Probability**:
   - **Question**: If the "defeated" word is chosen randomly from the list, what is the probability of selecting this word in one attempt out of 100 random selections?
   - **Answer**: There are 7 words that contain "defeated" when read sequentially: defeat. The total number of words is 29. Therefore, the probability is calculated as:
     \[
     \frac{1}{29} \approx 0.0345 \, \text{or} \, 3.45\% \text{ chance}
     \]

3. **Algebra Problem**:
   - **Question**: If the probability of selecting a word containing "defeated" is \(\frac{1}{29}\), and you want to select one word from the extract randomly, what is the expected number of attempts needed to find a word with "defeated"?
   - **Answer**: The expected value for finding a specific word can be calculated using the formula for expected value:
     \[
     E(X) = n \cdot p
     \]
     where \(n\) is the number of attempts and \(p\) is the probability of success on each attempt. Here, \(n = 100\) and \(p = \frac{1}{29}\). Therefore:
     \[
     E(X) = 100 \cdot \frac{1}{29} \approx 3.45 \, \text{attempts}
     \]
     This means you would expect to need about 4 attempts on average to find a word with "defeated".

4. **Combinatorics**:
   - **Question**: How many different arrangements are there of the 7 words that contain "defeated" when read from left to right and top to bottom?
   - **Answer**: Since each word is unique and distinct in its arrangement, the number of different arrangements is simply the factorial of the number of words:
     \[
     7! = 5040
     \]
     Therefore, there are 5040 possible arrangements.

5. **Series Sum**:
   - **Question**: If you have a list of all 29 words and you want to sum up the frequency of each word, what would be the total count?
   - **Answer**: To find the total count, add up the frequencies for each word:
     \[
     7f(defeated) + 10f(deter) = 7 \cdot 3 + 10 \cdot 2 = 38
     \]

6. **Area Calculation**:
   - **Question**: If you were to draw a square on the board with side length corresponding to the word lengths, where each letter is one unit long, what would be the area of this square?
   - **Answer**: Each word has 7 letters per word, and there are 29 words. The total number of letters in all words combined is:
     \[
     7 \times 3 + 10 \times 2 = 45
     \]
     Since each letter occupies one unit length on the board, the area of the square would be:
     \[
     \text{Area} = \text{side}^2 = 45 \, \text{square units}
     \]

7. **Average Speed**:
   - **Question**: If a person reads these words from left to right and then top to bottom at a speed of 10 words per minute, how long would it take to complete the entire list?
   - **Answer**: The total number of words is 29, and let's assume one word takes 30 seconds to read. Therefore:
     \[
     T = \frac{29}{10} \times 30 \, \text{seconds} = 87 \, \text{seconds}
     \]
     Converting this to minutes:
     \[
     87 \, \text{seconds} \div 60 = 1.45 \, \text{minutes}
     \]
     \[
     48 \, \text{seconds} + 1.45 \, \text{minutes} = 52.45 \, \text{minutes} \, (or) \, 870 \, \text{seconds}
     \]
     So, it would take approximately 8 minutes and 6 seconds to read the entire list.
