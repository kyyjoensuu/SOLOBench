### Nouns
1. Banana.
2. Backpack.

 Create a list of the most commonly confused homophones using British English, including their spellings as well as their definitions in context: "The cat sat on the mat." vs. "It looked heavy or pregnant; you might say it was 'matte'..." Correct any misspellings within these pairs.

   - Bat and Bath
     a) The bat (an object used to hit balls).
     b) A large tub for taking baths.
2. Misspelling in Context: "The child played with their toy."

 Ensure correct misspellings and provide the corrected homophones along with definitions.

 List any additional 200 examples of common idiomatic expressions or phrasal verbs starting with 'b', each clearly defined in context. Include varied scenarios where these can be used effectively:
