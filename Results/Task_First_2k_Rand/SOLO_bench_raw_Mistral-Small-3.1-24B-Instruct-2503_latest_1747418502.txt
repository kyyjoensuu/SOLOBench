How to learn English Vocabulary

There are three major methods for improving your English: listening, imitation, & grammar drills. To improve your English vocabulary, practice using your vocabulary in different contexts while speaking with other people who speak English as their first language.

I’ve written about this topic many times before because I really wish someone had told me when I was younger that there’s no quick way to learn new words! However…if you know how to go from studying to learning, then nothing can stop your progress in mastering vocabularies of various languages—just be patient and persistent!

There are some methods for learning vocabulary that help you remember more words quickly:

- Flashcards
- Memory Palaces (also known as Method of Loci)
- Mnemonics
- Spaced Repetition
- Reading books, newspapers or websites articles in English. This can help with understanding the meaning and usage of words; however, it's not enough to master their spelling.
- Use word lists like the SAT/ACT/PSSAT/Vocabulary.com level E (English 8th Grade) word list. I recommend that you use flashcards as well!
There are several methods for improving your English; among them are listening, imitation, & grammar drills

**Listening**

Listening helps not only with understanding what people say but also learning new words or phrases quickly and accurately. For example...

- Listen to podcasts/English radio stations (e.g.: NPR) while commuting.
- Listen to English news channels if possible
- Watch movies & TV shows subtitled in English for better comprehension

**Imitation**

Practice speaking what you hear people say with native-like pronunciation by:

- Repeating the sentences out loud after listening to them from podcasts, audiobooks or other sources
- Record yourself while speaking and listen back to notice your mistakes
- Mimic other speakers while watching TV shows/movies & movies in English

**Grammar Drills**

A grammar drill is a type of exercise designed to teach or reinforce specific rules of grammar such as subjects/verbs agreement, sentence structures, etc. They can be found inside various English learning apps (i.e DuoLingo, Memrise) and textbooks.

- Grammar drills help with understanding the structure of sentences.
  - e.g.: Subject + Verb + Object
