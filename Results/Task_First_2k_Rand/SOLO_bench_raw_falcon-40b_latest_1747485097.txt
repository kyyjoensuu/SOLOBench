... and its political you their faith of the UK and Wales; you can buy all that stuff in an hour, and then it has to keep the price down in a few hours, it's not that uncommon - the UK government has been doing this to everyone for decades now.

What that means is, if you're looking to have a really cool holiday here, you have to be prepared to pay full international shipping on anything, which is why if you're looking to buy something you should probably just do it and buy some UK goods online - it's not cheap, though.

If you go for something more exotic, you'll have to take a trip.>>COMMENT<< I'm going to be getting a car, and then I'm getting a house with your friend in the UK.

A friend of mine has got a great place for sale for £60-£70k in London or Paris.  The main downside to doing this is that he's only able to do it if he has a good relationship with his family and if he has an established work place - he's not going back and doing it in another country, he's going to get some people out of a life of poverty, and get a family.  His job prospects are very good as well - his employer was in the UK about 2 years ago or so ago, he has a wife and 2 kids.

 He's still a student at Cambridge University.>>COMMENT<< I see what you're saying and it's kinda obvious, but you never really know for sure that it isn't all it's hard to say which is what they are doing.>>COMMENT<< You can always get better people on the other end of things, like cars, homes, etc. But people can't get them to do that sort of thing.
