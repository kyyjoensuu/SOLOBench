[Bart:] I'm here to announce the end of your reign.
[Skuld:] A little harsh, but you're right—my time has passed. I don't see why I even fight for something as cruel and unfair as this. 
[Bart's voice:] No!  I mean yes!

[Fafnir is still in his dragon form, but has been knocked out by Bart.]

**The screen wipes from a closeup of Fafnir to Skuld and Bart.**

Skuld begins crying and hugging the unconscious form of her son.
Bart: What’s wrong with you?
[Skrud shakes Bart off.]
Skuld: Why would you hurt him, let alone try so hard to kill me?!
Bart: Because you’re a monster! And so is he!
He points directly at Fafnir, lying still on the ground.
Skuld [crying]: He’ll grow up one day…and realize how much of a burden I’ve been…
Skuld sobs as she holds her wounded child. A moment of tension passes between the two characters before Skuld breaks down and starts crying again.

[Bart looks away, then back.] So what now?

[A flashback briefly shows Sigurd lying unconscious in the battlefield.]

Skuld: [Looking at Bart] We win together or die alone!
