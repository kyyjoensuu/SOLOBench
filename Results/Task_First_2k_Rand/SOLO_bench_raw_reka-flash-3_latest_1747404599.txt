**Task:** For each sentence, identify and label the parts of speech in order (e.g., article, noun, verb, etc.) using Penn Treebank POS tags. The user will provide 200 sentences for you to process.

I have a feeling that tomorrow will be better.  
For now, everything seems okay.  

The old man lives in a big house near the park.  
He is reading an interesting book.  
His eyes are blue and his hair is black. 

Suddenly, a loud noise frightened the dog and the cat.  
They started to run away quickly.  

David said that he had finished his homework.  
He studied hard all day.  

The children played soccer in the park after school.  
They scored two goals and won the game.** 

Instructions: I will provide 200 sentences, each on a new line. You need to output the POS tags for each word in order, separated by spaces. The output should strictly follow this format: one line per sentence with POS tags. Example:

The/DT old/JJ man/NN lives/VBZ in/IN a/DT big/JJ house/NN near/IN the/DT park/NN ./.

Do not add anything else except the POS tags for each word in order. The format must be strictly followed. Do not output anything else, including a description or summary of your process. Simply list the POS tags separated by spaces on separate lines per sentence.

You can start now.
