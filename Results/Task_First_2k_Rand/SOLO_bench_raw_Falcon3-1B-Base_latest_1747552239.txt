The provided extract appears to be a non-transcriptible format and contains repeated sequences of dashes. However, I can create some mathematical questions based on the structure of this text. Let's focus on the numerical elements to generate interesting problems:

### Questions and Answers

#### Question 1: Counting and Basic Arithmetic
**How many times does the word "flame" appear in the extract?**

**Answer:**
To count the occurrences of "flame" in the given text, we can manually go through each segment and count the number of dashes that are preceded by the word "flame". The counts for specific segments are:
- In "Avenue", 6 times
- In "avenue", 3 times
- In "flame", 10 times
- In "fire", 4 times
- In "air", None
- In "firehouse", 1 time
- In "flame", 2 times
- In "flame", 8 more occurrences (as "flame," "flame," "flam," "flam")
- In "barrage", 4 times
- In "burlap", 1 time
- In "fire hose", 9 more occurrences (as "flame," "flame," "flam," "flame" etc.)
- In "carrion, 2 more occurrences
- Finally, in the last instance where you see that word, "flame" is counted 4 times.

Adding these up, we get a total of 47 occurrences. Therefore, the word "flame" appears 47 times in the extract.

#### Question 2: Frequency Analysis
**What is the frequency distribution of the words that contain "flame"?**

**Answer:**
To find the frequency distribution, we count the number of times each word containing "flame" occurs. The counts are as follows:
- In "Avenue", 6 times.
- In "a Avenue", 3 times.
- In "flame", 10 times.
- In "fire", 4 times.
- In "air", None.
- In "firehouse", 1 time.
- In "flame", 2 times.
- In "flame", 8 more occurrences (as "foam," "flame," "flame," "flame" etc.).
- In "barrage", 4 times.
- In "burlap", 1 time.
- In "fire hose", 9 more occurrences (similar to above).
- In "carrion", 2 more occurrences.

The frequency distribution is:
- "Avenue": 6
- "a Avenue": 3
- "flame": 10
- "fire": 4
- "air": 0
- "firehouse": 1
- "flame": 2
- "flame": 8
- "barrage": 4
- "burlap": 1
- "fire hose": 9
- "carrion": 2 more times.

#### Question 3: Probability
**What is the probability of randomly selecting a segment that starts with "flame"?**

**Answer:**
To determine the probability of randomly selecting a segment starting with "flame", we need to count the total number of segments and the number of segments starting with "flame".
- Total number of segments: 54
- Segments starting with "flame": 10 (as calculated from the previous frequency distribution)

The probability is given by the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of possible outcomes. Here, the favorable outcome is a segment that starts with "flame", and the total number of possible outcomes is the total number of segments. Therefore, the probability is:
\[ P(\text{flame-starting segment}) = \frac{\text{Number of segments starting with "flame"}}{\text{Total number of segments}} \]
\[ P(\text{flame-starting segment}) = \frac{10}{54} \]
Simplifying this fraction, we get:
\[ P(\text{flame-starting segment}) \approx 0.1852 \]
Expressed as a percentage, this is approximately 18.52%.

#### Question 4: Geometric Analysis
**If you were to draw the extract on a plane starting from its beginning and ending at its end, what would be the shortest distance between any two points on the line of the text? Assume that the dashes do not form a convex quadrilateral.**

**Answer:**
In this case, the given text is composed entirely of dashes. The dashes are not arranged in a way that would allow for a meaningful geometric analysis because they do not form a closed shape. However, if we were to break the dashes into segments and analyze them mathematically, we might use the concept of line segments and their properties.

For a straight segment, the shortest distance between any two points on the line can be calculated using the Euclidean distance formula:
\[ d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2} \]
where \( (x_1, y_1) \) and \( (x_2, y_2) \) are the coordinates of the two points.

However, since the dashes do not form a convex quadrilateral, there is no single shortest distance between any two points on this line. Each point can be arbitrarily close to another because the dashes fill up the space with gaps. Therefore, in practical terms, the shortest distance between any two points on a 1D line cannot be defined without additional information on how the dashes are distributed.

#### Question 5: Algorithmic Complexity
**What is the longest word in the extract, and what is its length? Is this a valid word in the English dictionary using all Scrabble letters?**

**Answer:**
To find the longest word in the extract and verify if it contains all the required Scrabble letters, we need to identify the longest sequence of characters by removing any duplicate characters and ensuring that the entire sequence constitutes one or more words in Scrabble.

From the list of words provided, the longest word is "flame," which has a length of 4.

To check if "flame" contains all the required Scrabble letters:
- The letters present in "flame" are: F, L, M, A, E

Thus, "flame" is correctly formed using the required Scrabble letters and can be considered as valid for Scrabble without any additional manipulation.

### Conclusion
These questions and answers demonstrate how to analyze mathematical concepts within a non-transcriptible piece of text by identifying patterns, frequencies, probabilities, and lengths. While this extract does not lend itself to direct mathematical analysis due to its format, it provides a unique opportunity to explore various numerical and algebraic problems.
