  Create a summary of the original text, then transform it into an alliterative poem that maintains both meaning and theme. This is how your response should be structured: Firstly, write A clear and precise summary.

**Summary:** 

The document consists mainly of examples showcasing usage patterns for various words across different contexts in English language discussions or literature analysis ("show 1"). It highlights the way certain terms are utilized to create a specific meaning (e.g., "sign" as an action), provides synonyms, discusses word origins and variations with prefixes like 's-', ('in-' etc.), then moves on to describe nuances such as usage frequency in different dialects or professions. The examples also give insights into idiomatic expressions ("show 2"), historical references where words appeared before a major event (e.g., "before Queen Victoria's reign" - the railway), and various spellings used across time, like 'stright' from another period denoting straightness.

**Poem:**

Silky sentences stream through shows,
Significance shown in semantic scopes.
Syntax subtly shifts so sweetly,
Sifting synonyms that signify:

*Sign-show-stars-signed-soon-shall-share space,
Synonyms serve such a specific spice.*

"Show-two" showcases signs' styles:
In idioms, instances inspire insights.

Before Queen Victoria's reign did arise,
Railways ran robust as roses rise.
'S-words span several centuries so slight,

Strightening stories in the silent night.

Terms transformed through time to test our tongue:

Diminish 'diminution', deepen discourse sprung!
*Different dialects deftly draw dreams:*

Gently, great words gallantly gleam.
