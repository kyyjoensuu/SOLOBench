1. Open Excel and insert a new module by pressing `Alt + M`.
2. Copy and paste the code into the module. The revised code should look something like this:
3. Run the macro by pressing `Alt + F8`, select "FormCalcCrtLtrI," and click "Run." The sum of the two numbers should be displayed in cell G9.
4. Open the Excel worksheet that contains the purchase details and the total value as calculated from Sheet2. If the total value is in cell B7 and VAT is in cell C7, you can use the following VBA code:
5. Run the VBA macro by pressing `Alt + F8`, select "FormCalcCrtLtrI," and click "Run." This will calculate the VAT on the total value.
6. Open the Excel worksheet with the range of cells you want to transfigure and Sheet2. Since VBA does not explicitly handle columns and rows like other programming languages, we can assume that `ThisWorkbook.Sheets("Sheet2").Range("A1:")` is the expected range.
7. Modify the VBA macro to transpose the specified range:
8. Run the macro by pressing `Alt + F8`, select "TransposeRange," and click "Run." This will transpose the specified range of cells, effectively switching columns to rows and vice versa.
9. **Undefined Variables**: If a variable is not defined before it is used in the macro, an error will occur during runtime. Ensure that all variables are properly declared before use.
10. **Cell References Issues**: Incorrectly specifying cells, especially by hardcoding row and column values that change over time or by using range names. Always ensure cell references are dynamic or include dynamic naming to cater to changing data structures.
11. **Range Name Mismatches**: Using ranges where the ranges do not exist or changing the number of rows or columns should be avoided as cell ranges may disappear unexpectedly.
12. **Type Errors**: Checking that the type of a variable is appropriately declared. For example, using `Dim R As Range` instead of simply declaring `R` without assigning it a scope like `Range`.
13. **Security Constraints**: VBA macros will raise errors if they attempt to access or modify sensitive areas of an application, such as protected workbooks. Use proper security settings and add the necessary permissions for your code to run correctly.
