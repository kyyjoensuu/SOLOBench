5. **Understand the Math Requirements**: Each monster will have a specific type of question they require for it to be defeated. Ensure that you are familiar with these requirements.
6. **Solve Questions Efficiently**: Solve each math question as quickly as possible while maintaining accuracy. This increases your chances of defeating more monsters and earning more points per correct answer.
