Game description:
In a series of mini-games, you must solve mathematical problems as needed to avoid the incoming monsters and continue your turn. To solve the math problem, you simply need to click on it and the answer will appear. For each question solved successfully, a new one will be revealed. There is no limit to how many questions can appear on your turn. The time runs out after solving each math test. Click on the correct answer from the options provided.

New game every minute
You have the option to try other games too. Try the new game with the number of questions (x) and speed per question (y). To do so, click on the game's title and you will be taking a break. A new game starts after x seconds!
<p><strong>How to earn points!</strong></p>
When a game is over, it shows several pictures of the monsters it attacked and what percentage of points they got. For example, if Monster 1 got 30%, Monster 2 got 45% (both correct answer!) and monster three got 60%. You can now click on "Start" in this game to continue your turn. If all questions of the current game are solved perfectly, you have 100 points. The more points you get for solving the math question correctly, the more points will return for every additional point that has not been reached yet.
<p><strong>How does the point system work?</strong></p>
Here is an image of the point system:
<img src=”https://image.php?img=images/game-reward-2.jpg” alt=”The point rate for every game." width=”100” height=”154″ hspace=”86″ ><br></p>
The more points you earn from the correct answer, the more points will be added to your score at this moment. Keep in my mind that it's the sum of all three values. After a while, there will always be something between these images. And don’t forget how to start a game: just click on the title!
<p><em>How many times can you play this minigames?</em></p>
If your speed and question count is at least 100 for X seconds then you are allowed to continue playing the game again.
<p>How do I start a new game?</p>
Go to the right of the "Start" button and click on it. This will open a menu of five games available for you to play. Each player has their own icon to select which is the user name that he or she wants to choose when starting this minigame. So, simply pick your favorite icon from those five (don't forget to enter your password!) and then click on the button with "Start" to continue playing.

Certainly! Here are a set of mathematical questions and corresponding detailed answers based on the provided web extract:

### Questions and Detailed Answers

#### Question 1: How many total points can you earn from solving all questions correctly in one game?
**Answer:**
In the game, the point system works as follows:
- For each correct answer, a certain number of points are given.
- The specific amount of points for each correct answer depends on the type of test (e.g., fractions, decimals, ratios).
- After solving all questions correctly, the total number of points is calculated by summing the points earned from each individual question.

For example, if:
- Monster 1 gets 30% points for the correct fraction answer.
- Monster 2 gets 45% points for the correct fraction answer.
- Monster 3 gets 60% points for the correct fraction answer.

The total number of points can be calculated as:
\[ \text{Total Points} = 0.3 + 0.45 + 0.6 \]

This simplifies to:
\[ \text{Total Points} = 1.35 \]

#### Question 2: If you solve each question correctly, how many points do you earn after solving the entire game?
**Answer:**
In the game, the player is allowed to solve the entire game multiple times. Once solved, the point system resets, and a new round starts with no previous scores affecting the outcome. Therefore, for each correct answer, the player earns one initial 100 points before any potential rewards from subsequent games or additional points from winning further rounds of games.

If a player solves all questions correctly:
- They earn a base score of 100 points in every game they play.
- After solving the entire game, they get back up to 100 points per game if any point system rewards are applied.

#### Question 3: How does the time limit work during the game?
**Answer:**
The game has a timer that runs at a specific interval. Here are the key points about the time limit:
- Each new game will start after x seconds of the game's previous session.
- If a player solves all questions correctly within these 30 seconds, they can continue playing a subsequent game.
- The exact duration for each game may vary depending on the time selected and the game type.

#### Question 4: What happens if there are multiple monsters attacking during a game?
**Answer:**
If monsters attack during a game, the player must solve a series of math questions to defeat the monsters and continue playing. The success in solving these mathematical problems determines whether they can proceed to the next round or not. Each monster defeated earns points for the player based on their correct answers to the associated math problem.

#### Question 5: How do you start a new game using the given options?
**Answer:**
To start a new game, follow these steps:
1. Click on the right border of the "Start" button. This opens a menu with five games available to play.
2. Browse through the list and select the game that interests you. Each player has their own icon to choose from.
3. Enter your user name in the corresponding field (if required). This is often necessary for logging into the website or for specific accounts to save statistics or progress.
4. Click on the "Start" button once you have completed selecting and confirmed the chosen game. This starts a new play session with no previous game scores affecting the outcome.

### Additional Mathematical Concepts and Tips

#### Question 6: How can you optimize your strategy to maximize points?
**Answer:**
To optimize your strategy and maximize points, consider the following tips:
1. **Understand the Math Requirements**: Each monster will have a specific type of question they require for it to be defeated. Ensure that you are familiar with these requirements.
2. **Solve Questions Efficiently**: Solve each math question as quickly as possible while maintaining accuracy. This increases your chances of defeating more monsters and earning more points per correct answer.
3. **Manage Time Wisely**: Use the timer effectively. Try to maintain a steady pace as too much or too little time can disrupt your performance.
4. **Take Breaks If Necessary**: While it's important to stay focused during gameplay, taking short breaks can help refresh your mind and prevent burnout. Resume playing when you feel refreshed.
5. **Practice with Different Monsters**: Practice solving various problem types until you become comfortable and confident in your skills for each monster type. This will make it easier to quickly defeat them and maximize scores.

#### Question 7: How does the point system adjust over time?
**Answer:**
The point system is designed so that more points are awarded when a question is solved perfectly, leading to better performance during subsequent games. Here’s how this works:
- After successfully solving the entire game, you receive a base score of 100 points.
- The number of additional points earned from further games depends on how many times you solve the same types of questions correctly in subsequent games.
- For example, if you get 30% for the first correct answer, 45% for the second, and 60% for the third, your total score increases by:
  \[ 0.7 \times 100 = 70 \]

The system is dynamic and adjusts based on the total number of points earned in subsequent games. You can see this value increase over time as you collect more points from each correct answer.

### Conclusion
These questions and answers provide a comprehensive overview of the game mechanics, point system, and tips for optimizing performance. They should help players understand how to play effectively and earn maximum points by solving math problems efficiently and strategically.
