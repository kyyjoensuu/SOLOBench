The prompt is a list of English vocabulary words. I don't see any specific error or mistake in this list.
However, if you meant to ask for an example sentence using some of these words together, here's one:

"After carefully analyzing the data from his research, the scientist delivered a compelling presentation explaining the findings, which could have far-reaching impacts on medical treatments."

Or if you want me to pick out a few words and use them in a phrase that makes sense, I can do that. Let me know how else I can help!
