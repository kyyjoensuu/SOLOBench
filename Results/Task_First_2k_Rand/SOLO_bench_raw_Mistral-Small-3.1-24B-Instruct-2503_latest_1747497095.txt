## Introduction

**Swords and Circuits** is a dystopian cyberpunk game where players take on the roles of characters in a world that blends elements of medieval fantasy and advanced technology. The game combines gritty urban environments with high-tech gadgetry, giving players a unique experience.

In this universe, humanity has reached the pinnacle of technological advancement, but not all progress comes without cost. Society is ruled by powerful corporations intent on exploiting anyone they can to maintain their power and wealth. The world is filled with danger from corporate goons looking to intimidate and harass, ruthless criminals seeking easy money, and advanced artificial intelligence with mysterious agendas.

The cybernetic augmentation market thrives in a world that values efficiency and power above all else. Yet beneath the surface lies a dark underbelly where cybernetics and bioengineering are twisted into horrors that defy nature itself.

**S&D: A Dystopian Cyberpunk Game.**

In Swords and Circuits, each player's character is unique. Characters are defined by their attributes (strength, dexterity, constitution, intelligence, wisdom, charisma), skills, equipment, and a core skill set that gives them special abilities tailored to the world they inhabit.

As you play through your adventures in this post-apocalyptic world of neon lights and steel shadows, you'll gain more power and abilities as you earn experience points. Customize your character to thrive in any scenario while battling against overwhelming odds on a personal quest for survival or to make sense of the world you inhabit.

Whether you're a seasoned veteran of the Corporate Wars or starting fresh after being dumped into reality from an experimental lab, the rules that follow will help guide you through what it means to be alive and well in this grim future. There’s plenty of danger lurking around every corner!

## Basic Rules and Mechanics

In Swords & Circuits:

- **Attribute Scores:**
  Every character possesses six distinct attribute scores: Strength (STR), Dexterity (DEX), Constitution (CON), Intelligence (INT), Wisdom (WIS), Charisma (CHA).

- **Combat:**
  Combat involves calculating modifiers based on weapons, armor, and attributes. Attacks are resolved by rolling 1d6 + damage modifier.

- **Dice Mechanics:**
  Rolls in Swords & Circuits primarily revolve around d6 dice rolls with associated modifiers tied to various player skills/abilities, weapons/cybernetics and situational factors.

### Attributes

Attributes measure the inherent abilities of your character. The attribute scores range from 1 (very bad) to 6 (exceptional). Each attribute has a base score that you can allocate in addition to the starting point allocation.

#### Attribute Scores:

-  **Strength (STR):**
  A measure of physical power, Strength affects melee combat and carrying weight.

-   **Dexterity (DEX):**
    Dexterity is important for tasks requiring finesse, agility, and hand-eye coordination. This can range from lock-picking to dodging attacks or performing acrobatics.

-   **Constitution (CON):**
     Constitution represents the character's physical endurance, health, overall resilience, and well-being

-   **Intelligence (INT):**
    Intelligence is how quickly someone grasps new ideas, solves puzzles, and gains knowledge about various things in the world around them. This stat reflects IQ.

-  **Wisdom (WIS):**
   Wisdom represents common sense, empathy with others, and intuition. It reflects experience and street smarts as much as book learning

-  **Charisma (CHA):**
    Charisma affects how persuasive or intimidating a character is when speaking to others.

### Spending Your Attributes:

In S&C, you have access to a pool of points which are assigned during the character creation phase. By distributing these points into your abilities, you can create a unique and powerful persona suited for whatever kind of adventure they get involved in!

Players will allocate 30 Attribute Points among their six initial attributes.

You may also choose to spend a few points on skills (max +10) but are encouraged not to overlook important character traits such as STRENGTH or LUCKNESS — the very essence that drives your game’s story. We’ll discuss skill checks shortly, don’t worry!

### Weapons

#### Melee Weapons
- **Damage Types:**
   - Bash: This bludgeoning damage type is typical for weapons like maces, hammers or fists.
 -  *Slash*: This sharp edge based damage type occurs when using blades in combat such as katanas.
   - Puncture*: Penetrating through skin and protective gear; think swords, spears & knives.

#### Ranged Weapons
- **Ranged Damage Types**:
     - Piercing: A bullet that travels through the air is considered piercing. Gun wounds often take time to bleed out over but can still render one unconscious or even kill instantly.
  - Kinetic Energy:

## Swords and Circuits Combat

Combat in *S&C* uses the following simplified rules based on basic attack mechanics.

### Initative:
The player with highest Dexterity goes first, then those who roll the tiebreaker (1d6+dex) to decide order of attacks. If all else fails, highest Int attribute scores get dibs on deciding who’s up next!

#### Movement

How far you can move depends on your DEX modifier:

| D | Speed |
| --- | ---   |
| 0-1    | Slow (2m round)     |
|   2      | Moderate     (6 meters round) |
|   3     | Fast (10 m/round )|
|   4 || Very fast (*18 meters per turn*))       |
|   5     | Extremely fast *(up to 32m)*)         |
|    6      | *Insane speed — (*up to 50 m*)       |

#### Action

Player makes the attack roll against a modifier tied to your weaponry or weapon of choice.

Initiative is determined by the highest Dexterity modifier. If they tie up, use `a roll of 1d6 + DEX` — whoever has most gets their action first!
- **Roll:** On every turn players can: Move `3x Your character's DEX mod (metres)`, perform one basic attack
- *Standard Action*: Make a basic Attack or special maneuvers.
  - *Move*  : (3 x character's Distance modifier — DEX)
   - *Basic Actions*.:
    - *Attacks:* A successful hit would require hitting the armor class and adding damage mod. For this to work successfully, player has to roll attack with weapon mod: `d6 + weapon damage mod`

In any action during combat you may also be able to perform basic special abilities tied into your skills or character attributes.

---

## Character Creation

Creating the character can be a fun process; first and foremost is choosing what kind of gameplay experience you want for yourself. Choose your gender, background and other traits to begin with!

Next decide if they are Human or Cyborg — Human characters start out as regular humans while cyborgs possess augmentations which have varying bonuses/penalizes based on the specific enhancements installed.

All starting classes will receive *+10 Attribute Points.* If you go human (you start with no enhancements), you can allocate all these points into abilities or skills. If you're a robot there's built-in base stats, but additional attribute increases would only come from any special upgrades purchased later in the game

For each choice of class, you will receive an *extra +10 Attribute Points and core skill set*, which gives unique advantages and disadvantages within the various playable professions available.

After selecting attributes for your character — which determine the base stats & modifiers tied into them — allocate the necessary skills which allow actions to happen in-game like hacking, lockpicking, etc. This is also where you would decide whether or not certain special abilities should be learned through practice & experience

Once you are content with your initial allocation of points for attributes and abilities, begin equipping your weaponry (ranged, melee) & choosing an armor type which will affect how well players can handle themselves in battle as defensive tactics go.

---

### Attributes and Skills  — How do they Work?

#### Dice Rolling and Modifiers

Whenever you need to determine success during *Sword & Circuits*, check the corresponding skill or attribute, and add any relevant modifiers. Most rolls are modified by adding the number of successes (on a d6) plus modifiers; some actions require that multiple successes be achieved before success is considered true.

Dice are rolled on 1d6 with modifiers tied to attributes affecting base values being used in this resolution step:

For each task players undertake, you'll need to determine which ability & relevant skill comes into play followed by dice rolls and applying bonuses/penalties if applicable —

#### Skills

The table provided below showcases an example of a few basic skills for **S&C.** Remember that each character in your game will have these available as potential actions they can take during gameplay! *These are simply examples,* so you may need to come up with your own list, or modify these ones!

| Skill     | Description                                          || Base attribute |
| ---       |------------------------------------------------------|| ----------    ||
| Aced       | Allows player to avoid incoming harm by reacting quickly     | Agility|
| Hack       | Breaking a lock/piercing defenses on computers.               +Int
| Perception  | Player’s ability to notice & identify hidden details (or dangers) in their surroundings.                 *+Wisdom*
| Persuade    | Convincing someone of an action or viewpoint, even when untrue (charisma)                       || +Cha
| Quick Draw   | Allows players faster reaction time drawing weaponry/equipment from a holsters/dressed up       || +dex

---

####  Core Skill List:

Incorporate the below list for *S&C Character creation!* The more you have invested in these abilities, it affects how well character performs during any related actions (for example: hacking might require quick thinking & problem-solving skills — thus intelligence).

| Skill | Description                          ||Base attribute |
| ---     |--------------------------------------||------------       ||
| Aim        | Shooting straight for accuracy     ||+Dex
| Assault     | Attacking through armor       +++Int|
| Disarm   | Safely disable someone’s weapon            +Wis

There are various other *Core skills* that players may want to get involved in and learn more about. Some examples can be found below for each core ability type:

---

#### Special Abilities
Special abilities — things you do with your character beyond a normal player's capabilities — are determined by how many points (in total) have been invested into one of the attributes.

**Example:** A player who has 20 pts in **Intelligence,** gets *+3 to Hacking skill* & +1 point towards *any special skills*. These special abilities can help distinguish players or set your character apart. For instance, perhaps you can dodge faster than normal or hack into systems faster.

---

## Example Characters

### Samurai Cyborg
The Samurai Cybernetic is a character that blends advanced combat skills and cybernetic enhancements to excel in violent close-quarters fighting — *think quick reactions!* If it comes down to hacking or hack-and-slash type attacks, these robo-warriors have what’s necessary.

- **Attributes**  | Example Character (Attribute Scores):
    -  Strength:   4
     - Dexterity:      5
     - Constitution: 3
     - Intelligence:    3
     - Wisdom:         2
  - Charisma:       3
- **Skills:** Hack, Assault *+10*

> *These are simply examples, so you might need to come up with your own list*

This cybernetic enhancement will provide bonuses in physical combat (including strength enhancements); additionally they'll have added reaction time allowing for better dodging attacks or aiming shots!

With 20 points of **Strength**, the Samurai Cybernetics gets *+1 point towards aim* & +3 towards their *assault skills.* They also receive additional abilities to *aim and shoot,* making them excellent marksmen. Plus: the extra cyber-augmentation makes it possible for this character to have even quicker reactions — *dodging attacks with ease!*

---

### Ninja Cyborg
The Ninja Cybernetics is more of a quiet, stealthy type. Great for infiltration missions and other situations which require finesse rather than brute force; if you need them hacking into systems or breaking down doors then these guys will be happy to do the work!

*Attributes for the Ninja Cybernetic:*
    -  Strength:      3
     - Dexterity:       5
     - Constitution:  2
                +Intellect*:   *4*
    - Wisdom:         **3**
                    - *Charisma:*                   1

Skills: Hack, Perception, Persuasion & Stealth.

These robots come built with some advanced cybernetic enhancements that help them in terms of moving silently (which increases their chances of success stealthily approaching targets); being invisible at nighttime gives ninjas an edge over any enemies in dark environments.

The Ninja Cyborgs have *+1 in stealth* and +2 towards perception! These skills make them well-suited for infiltration types of missions or those where stealth is paramount to success. In addition, this character has enhanced reaction times allowing more efficient attacking without alerting anyone — *ideal as ninjas need!* Finally, having +4 Intelligence enables better hacking opportunities!
