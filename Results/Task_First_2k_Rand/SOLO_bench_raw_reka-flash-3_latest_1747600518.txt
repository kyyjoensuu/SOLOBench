To solve this problem, we need to generate a list of 200 meaningful sentences using random words from predefined lists of nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, and conjunctions. Each sentence should follow specific grammatical structures to ensure they are coherent and meaningful.

### Approach
1. **Data Preparation**: We start by defining lists of words for each part of speech (nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, and conjunctions). These lists will be used to construct the sentences.
2. **Sentence Templates**: We use predefined sentence templates that include placeholders for different parts of speech. The placeholders will be replaced with randomly selected words from the respective lists.
3. **Random Selection**: For each template, we randomly select words from the appropriate lists to fill in the placeholders. This ensures that each sentence is unique and varies in structure and vocabulary.
4. **Sentence Generation**: Using the templates and word lists, we generate 200 sentences by iterating through the process of selecting a template, filling it with random words, and ensuring proper capitalization and punctuation.

### Explanation
1. **Data Preparation**: We have predefined lists of nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, and conjunctions. These lists contain a variety of words that can be combined to form meaningful sentences.
2. **Sentence Templates**: The templates use placeholders (e.g., `{adj}` for adjective, `{noun1}` for first noun) to structure the sentences. This allows us to vary sentence structure while ensuring grammatical correctness.
3. **Random Selection**: For each template, we replace placeholders with randomly selected words from the appropriate lists. This ensures that each sentence is unique and uses different combinations of words.
4. **Sentence Generation**: By iterating through the process 200 times, we generate a diverse set of sentences that are both grammatically correct and meaningful, thanks to the random selection of words and varied sentence structures.
