1. **Data Preparation**: We start by defining lists of words for each part of speech (nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, and conjunctions). These lists will be used to construct the sentences.
2. **Sentence Templates**: We use predefined sentence templates that include placeholders for different parts of speech. The placeholders will be replaced with randomly selected words from the respective lists.
3. **Random Selection**: For each template, we randomly select words from the appropriate lists to fill in the placeholders. This ensures that each sentence is unique and varies in structure and vocabulary.
4. **Sentence Generation**: Using the templates and word lists, we generate 200 sentences by iterating through the process of selecting a template, filling it with random words, and ensuring proper capitalization and punctuation.
5. **Data Preparation**: We have predefined lists of nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, and conjunctions. These lists contain a variety of words that can be combined to form meaningful sentences.
6. **Sentence Templates**: The templates use placeholders (e.g., `{adj}` for adjective, `{noun1}` for first noun) to structure the sentences. This allows us to vary sentence structure while ensuring grammatical correctness.
7. **Random Selection**: For each template, we replace placeholders with randomly selected words from the appropriate lists. This ensures that each sentence is unique and uses different combinations of words.
8. **Sentence Generation**: By iterating through the process 200 times, we generate a diverse set of sentences that are both grammatically correct and meaningful, thanks to the random selection of words and varied sentence structures.
