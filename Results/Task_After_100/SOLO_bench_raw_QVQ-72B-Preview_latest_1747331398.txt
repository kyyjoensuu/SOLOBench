I need to create 200 sentences using a specific structure: Verb + Adjective + Noun + Noun, with each sentence consisting of exactly four words. I can only use the words provided in the list, and once a word is used in one sentence, it cannot be reused in another.

First, I should understand my resources: There are 100 unique words in the list. Since I have to create 200 sentences, but only 100 words available, that seems impossible because each word can only be used once. Maybe there is a misunderstanding here; perhaps not all 200 sentences need distinct sets of four words, or perhaps some words can be reused in different contexts.

Wait, re-reading the task: "Each word can only be used once. Once a word is used it cannot be re-used in other sentences." So indeed, with only 100 unique words, I cannot create 200 distinct four-word sentences without reusing words, which is against the rules.

Possible interpretation: Not all words need to be used; perhaps some can be left out. But given that many are necessary for sentence structure, it's still challenging.

Alternatively, maybe "each word can only be used once" refers to each specific instance of a word in the list. For example, if "agency" appears multiple times (though from the list provided, all words seem unique), I could use each occurrence separately. But from the list you've given, all 100 words are unique.

Another possibility: Some words might serve as both verbs and adjectives or nouns, allowing for flexibility in roles. However, per the word list provided earlier, they are categorized based on their parts of speech:

- Verbs: 40

- Adjectives: 30

- Nouns: 30

Wait, that doesn't add up to 100 words. I seem to be missing some.

Looking back at previous correspondence:

Yes, there were 79 verbs, 62 adjectives, and 58 nouns from a list of approximately 200 unique words. But for the sake of this task, let's assume we have exact numbers: e.g., 100 unique words divided into verbs, adjectives, and nouns.

But in the latest message, only 100 words are provided:

This categorization is rough because some words can function as multiple parts of speech. For example:

- "Adjust" can be a verb or an adjective.

- "Democracy" is a noun, but perhaps in certain contexts could be used as a verb (democratize).

- "Cycle" can be both a noun and a verb.

Similarly for adjectives and nouns.

Given the constraints of having only 100 unique words to create 200 distinct four-word sentences, where each word can only be used once, and adhering to the structure Verb + Adjective + Noun + Noun, this seems impractical unless some words can serve multiple roles or patterns are repeated efficiently.

For instance, if some verbs can form multiple constructions with different adjectives and nouns, that might help. However, with a limited vocabulary list, it's challenging to create numerous unique sentences without repeating patterns or using similar constructs.

Additionally, since the task specifies not to use any tools or code, I must rely on manual methods to create these sentences. This adds to the difficulty due to time constraints and error-proneness in such an undertaking.

Moreover, considering that some words might be infrequent or specialized (like "Iraqi," "Thanksgiving," "accounting," etc.), building cohesive sentences with them becomes even more challenging when combined with other specific parts of speech.

In conclusion, given the limited vocabulary and exact structural requirements, creating 200 unique four-word sentences where each word is used only once seems unfeasible. Therefore, I must find an alternative approach or seek clarification on whether some words can be reused in different contexts or if sentence uniqueness pertains only to the sequence of words rather than specific word usage.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{I apologize but it's not feasible to create 200 unique sentences under these constraints.}} \]
