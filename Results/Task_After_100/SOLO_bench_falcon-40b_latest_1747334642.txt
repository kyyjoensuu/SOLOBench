1. Click on the above line: "Return your answer here"
2. On the next page that comes up paste that as the input for your first sentence, then click Execute (If you are new to HackerRank you may need to do the above two steps differently than outlined).
3. On the next page that comes up (after you've run you r code) click on the link that says you "Want to get more familiar with this problem type?"
4. You will now be in Hackerrank's Sandbox program, just as if you had first come to practice coding instead of taking the test
5. Put your code, formatted as I've said above, at the top of the Sandbox program and click Execute (it took me several tries to figure that out :))
6. Go back to the challenge test page and paste "{"results": [....]}" with your results in place of "...."
