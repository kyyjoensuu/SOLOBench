Example:
1. Iraqi celebrate Thanksgiving giant country

Now, this is tricky, but I need to create 100 sentences using the words from the given list. First, I need to make sure that each word is used exactly once and doesn't repeat. Let me start by going through the list and assigning them appropriately. I must create verb + adjective + noun + noun structure each time.

Starting with Iraqi as a country, maybe "Iraqi" can be used in a sentence like "Iraqi celebrate Thanksgiving giant country". Checking the example, that works. Then "celebrate" is a verb. The next words would be adjectives and nouns. The tricky part is ensuring that each word is only used once. For instance, "Thanksgiving" is an event, so maybe use it as a noun.

Next, "accounting" could be a noun, but to fit the structure, I need a verb first. Maybe "accounting adjust agency..." Wait, "adjust" is a verb. So "Accounting adjust agency alliance"? Hmm, does that make sense? Adjust in an accounting context might relate to adjusting agencies or alliances. Not sure, but proceeding.

Continuing down the list: "anger" as a noun. Verb could be "express", adjective "hostile". So "Anger express hostile enemy"? Maybe. Then "appearance" as a noun: "Appearance affect bedroom environment"? Adjective "barely"? Not sure. Need to check the structure again.

This process requires careful planning to avoid repeats and ensure all words are used once. Each time I use a word, I need to cross it off the list. Let's try to approach this methodically, going through each word and assigning them where they fit best in the sentence structure.
