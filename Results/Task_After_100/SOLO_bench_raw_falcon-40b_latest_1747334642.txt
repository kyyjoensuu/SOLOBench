, each sentence must conform to the word rules and sentence structure constraints laid out here. Do not use any punctuation other than periods to mark the end of sentences. Do not put each sentence on a different line. For example your file will look like this:  
> > 1. It's good luck that we are only exporting the best of our citizens to Iraq.

Please return one single line with all your responses, and return on this page.

Please do so in the form {"response number": sentence}.

Remember that this is Python, not C++, so you will have to build the arrays you'd use in a different language.

Please follow along with these directions:
1. Click on the above line: "Return your answer here"
2. On the next page that comes up paste that as the input for your first sentence, then click Execute (If you are new to HackerRank you may need to do the above two steps differently than outlined).
3. On the next page that comes up (after you've run you r code) click on the link that says you "Want to get more familiar with this problem type?"
4. You will now be in Hackerrank's Sandbox program, just as if you had first come to practice coding instead of taking the test

5. Put your code, formatted as I've said above, at the top of the Sandbox program and click Execute (it took me several tries to figure that out :))
6. Go back to the challenge test page and paste "{"results": [....]}" with your results in place of "...."

That should be it!
