She looks at him feeling the shared energy connecting between them as he smiles back acknowledging finally all those challenges along their journey made it clearer that indeed there truly is a common purpose uniting both of them just like never before while continuing forward deeper discovery for life together brighter closer understanding in much more ways eventually realizing if everyone could see and understand this simple truth maybe one day things would get better at last finding true love holding each other through all future challenges they may face.",
