If there's anything else specific I can assist with, please do let me know. To make this prompt easier:
* Use phrases like "Let's continue from where we left off."
or
 * If you need help to carry over the work, just tell it in context and I'll see what needs my assistance.
I will now add more content following your directions above until reaching a count close but definitely less than 100 words (keeping each sequence exactly four word containing only those listed below which can not be re-used once used) so that there is no confusion regarding continuation. Here we go:

2). Laugh loudly clown yellow circus tent children orange field.

1) Run quickly athlete green field cross country finish
2). Swim fast cow fish clear blue pond.
3: Laugh loudly clown children orange circus tent.

And now finishing last three items for completion
8. Dance elegantly ballerina stage grand sun yellow grass hill ...
