1. Words are separated by spaces and punctuation (comma/space)
2. The sentence does not need to make sense but it must be grammatically correct
3. Each word in the set MUST BE USEFUL TO THE SENTENCE that you provide. If you want me to add a word, please just ask
4. Choose the correct word or phrases at least once in each sentence. Try to use the same noun and verb, but if this is not possible, simply choose two related ones that don't sound like you are cheating by using them together. For example, I would choose "What do you enjoy doing?", which can be used with nouns such as playing video games for fun or listening to music online. I could also use the word "to," if we wanted a stronger association between one subject and another than their shared noun or verb; using it in this way might not only change the meaning of your question, but even alter its tone so you are not being deceptive about knowing these answers beforehand!
5. Keep track of your own words when using a tool like GPT-3 or any other language processing algorithm. It may seem confusing at first because people often try their best when using new concepts like AI technology while writing code, research papers, etc., yet sometimes they fall into traps themselves due to overzealousness caused by having so many possibilities available to them! To avoid this problem, try breaking down each part of your sentence apart from any direct influences behind it.
6. Don't forget about grammar and syntax rules when composing these types of sentences, especially since most current tools cannot deal well enough to handle multiple meanings within just one phrase! Sometimes you need more than two words for clarity, which will result in extra difficulty finding suitable replacements later on so do your best not to compromise upon anything.
