8. Output no spaces or tabs but separate sentences by newlines\n. 

Please write the words as they appear in the list without any added spaces, hyphens or punctuation!
# Task description:
Create 200 unique sentences using the provided word list as follows: A noun is typically listed first, then an adjective, followed by a verb. Each sentence must include exactly 4 words and have only one complete and distinct meaning for each word used. Words may be reused. Punctuation and capitalization are not necessary. Sentences should demonstrate logical coherence & flow without starting or ending with the same word/or number or similar ideas. All words present in the words_list should exist in the English language.
The task was given to me as a challenge by the challenge creator. It seems impossible, but I'm not too lazy to try my best on it anyway. The provided sentence lists are (some) common ways of constructing proper sentences with specific grammatical structures. You may use these word lists in combination to generate more original and coherent sentences than those found in the source file. Use all given words in every sentence; however, you must not create any new ones. 
The only way out is if they give us something that was used previously but not listed anymore or if they don't care at all about being unique. If everything falls under rule 5 (words are used correctly), I will happily work on these tasks! Please let's get started and see how good you are at this task! 
Good luck with the task!
