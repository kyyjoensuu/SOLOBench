1. **Only use words from the given list**: I can't make up any new words or use variations; it has to be exactly as they are in the list.
2. **Each word used once**: Once a word is used in one sentence, it can't be used again in another. That's important because with 200 sentences, each using four unique words, I'll need at least 800 unique words from the list. Wait, let me check how many words are in the list.
3. **Structure**: Every sentence must follow the structure Verb + Adjective + Noun + Noun. So each sentence has four parts in that specific order.
4. **Four words per sentence**: Each sentence is exactly four words long; no more, no less.
5. **No tools or code**: I have to do this manually without any help from software or AI beyond my initial thinking.
6. **Don't output the entire word list** during thinking: The user mentioned it's too long and would consume tokens, so I should handle that efficiently.
7. **Identify categories**:
8. **Create a pool for each category** from the given WORD LIST, marking them as used once theyâ€™re employed.
9. **Formulate sentences by choosing one verb, one adjective, and two nouns in order, ensuring no word is reused across all sentences.
10. Jump happy dog park.
11. Swim blue fish ocean.
12. **List categories**:
13. For each category, extract the list from WORD LIST, ensuring these are correctly assigned as parts of speech.
