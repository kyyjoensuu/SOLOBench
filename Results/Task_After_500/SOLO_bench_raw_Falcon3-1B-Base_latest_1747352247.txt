8. Don’t add any explanation at the beginning
Examples given below are to be avoided:
- Create a set of instructions, for instance.
- What if <noun> is used three times in a row?
- The problem is that "The problem of _pigeons,_ which are the worst birds in every aspect."
- You had this sentence wrong: "I could not find any solutions," then you have to find one solution. I'm afraid I don't do that!"
- "[Your name] could not solve the problems!" This is too vague and it should be specific.
- Give examples of sentences you’re having difficulty with!
- You shouldn’t put parentheses around your lists of nouns, verbs, etc., and they should always be in lowercase or mixed case.
Rules:
- Do not use punctuation in any way to create a list (e.g. [My name], My name is…)
- Do not use quotation marks
- DO NOT output the word order information of the input sentence
Examples:
Sentence: I don’t like the idea that our country should be under the control of a foreign power. Solution: I don’t like the idea that our country should be under the control of a foreign powerful state
Explanation: I don't like the idea that our country should be under the control of a foreign powerful state because it is undesirable, and my opinion is supported by reason.
Explanation: My own thoughts about this topic are in conflict with your. That is why we need to settle this issue peacefully, without getting killed.
Example (incorrect): If <noun> happens, do not think about the fact that <noun> does not happen.
Example (correct): The problem of _pigeons,_ which are the worst birds in every aspect.
Explanation: 2) You shouldn’t be talking about a problem here; you should instead be describing what _is_ the problem.
3.) You may want to specify how many words there are in your sentence. E.g. "I can write this whole paragraph with only one word, six syllables; if one were to be required of him to express himself on this matter clearly and succinctly." or even better to make it about 4-5 words. Or you may want to be able to create a word in whatever language you choose (e.g. Spanish, French, etc), so try to keep these requirements as simple as possible.
Explanation: As you probably know, when we take a course in another language, the vocabulary and grammar sometimes differ significantly from what would naturally flow in that language, hence some translations are nonsensical, or even confusing at times. However, many languages have built-in redundancies, or redundancy between different language structures. Some of the most common redundancies include pronouns ("he", "she"), "we", "us", and adverbs ("then"...") in their base position, which could be seen as a bonus. So we suggest you take whatever word your sentence includes that you think is redundant. Example: If it says "if they can't find enough water to drink," you can delete any redundancy before you output the word because both languages are equivalent, but for the sake of example, suppose you took this one: "We need to be the most useful in our community" and replace with something like "that we may be the most helpful". That's all you need to keep. Note that these sentences should be complete sentences that require some effort on your part to solve, not those with very basic rules such as this one: "If they can find enough water…"
Examples: "In spite of what the media says..." etc. and "The problem was that..." etc. As mentioned earlier it is important you follow all the rules strictly in creating the sentences. "Don't ask me how to break it, I don't know it..."
Example: The solution might be as simple as “You should never get tired, for we are all working to the best of our ability”.
Your Task is Simple:
• To make an input sentence from your given vocabulary.
• Every single sentence must follow the structure Verb + Adjective + Noun + Noun. Example of a sentence is Verb Subject Subject Verb.
1. Your vocabulary is provided as a text list. See the Examples below.
2. The example sentences are provided for you to see your results in real-time.
3. If you find them interesting, just say that because we really like you.
Example Input: ["to", "that", "which", "in"]
Output should be as follows: Verb Subject Subject Verb ("To",
Subject of First Noun, Verb & Subject of Second Noun.) Example A sentence with all the rules included can be found here. Note that sometimes you will have to make some changes in your sentence. For example, if you get a “The problem is we did not” which can be changed to something like "We do not...","No one...","or nobody...", so that it fits in a list."
Explanation: All of them are wrong. I'll explain further what the examples were talking about. We had ‘A’ choose and put it in an empty field then pick up “A” and put the second sentence there. You probably think like, “well you can make A talk”. So we will use that word “like”, put two words next to each other in the box, as long as (the first word is followed by a noun), then put a period after it, as a sign, the sentence is finished.
Rules:
1.- Only the list contains -e.txt file (*.gz) and cannot contain *.json or *.xml formats
2.- Do not use any tool to achieve the task.
3.- No explanation need.
