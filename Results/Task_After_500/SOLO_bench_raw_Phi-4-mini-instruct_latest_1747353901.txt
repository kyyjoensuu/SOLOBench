27. Clearly without doubt identifiably distinct immediately visibly undeniably unmistakabily unquestionably recognisable readily and clearly perceptibly obvious in all respects even by the most casual observer such as yourself; so there is nothing to fear or worry about concerning his face ; everything can be observed from outside equally, not just experts like me but also anyone else very well able with perfect vision , for example

31. Clearly unambiguously distinct and irrefutably observable most definitely as clearly obvious to everyone by an uncomplicated look just like you can already see here from the outside , for anyone with normal sight ; no detailed examination is necessary or even desired 
32. Very unlikely possibly maybe perhaps rarely occasionally rather probably at least potentially quite possible  only sometimes very likely almost certainly but still not absolutely certain without doubt in no uncertain terms inevitable
33. Without question undoubtedly, clearly distinct and unambiguously visible unmistakably obvious right away to any casual observer as well as experts or anyone else with an observant eye ; nothing special is required for a close examination 
34. Very probable often relatively frequently perhaps probably maybe likely possibly somewhat unlikely nearly impossible very rare extremely seldom rarely without doubt occasionally almost always certainly usually reliably consistently fairly commonly quite confidently generally in no small way
35. Almost definitely essentially unambiguously highly identifiable visually unmistakably immediately obvious to the naked eye right from this picture alone as anyone can plainly perceive even a casual or non-professional observer 
36. Without question absolutely, completely and undeniably certain ; irrefutably 100% , just like that guy on every billboard here in Argentina with his ridiculous expression who always looks like he wants you guys not to buy anything at all for some reason
37. Very likely almost certainly probably potentially maybe perhaps possibly highly probable quite commonly reasonably oftentoyous times very fairly more or less often relatively frequently  usually infallibly occasionally sometimes regularly nearly constantly consistently normally reliably most of the time without doubt with complete certainty totally completely absolutely always in every single regard , just like this guy on those billboards who seems to never stop screaming at you 
38. Obviously unambiguously extremely obviously distinctive very noticeable quite easily distinguishable almost instantly recognizable visually unmistakably distinct and uniquely identifiable by any casual observer anywhere ; no detailed examination needed because it is obvious simply from the outside
39. Invariably probably often frequently relatively usually commonly fairly regularly reliably consistently reasonably repeatedly in an ordinary sense without fail at all times  practically always with complete assurance on every occasion , just like that guy everywhere screaming about not buying anything 
40. Clearly unambiguously immediately clearly unmistakable very obviously distinct and easily perceptible identifiable visibly evident as anyone can plainly perceive it directly from the outside even by a non-professional casual observer
41. Very unlikely infrequently maybe rarely possibly only sometimes slightly more likely quite often  probably almost surely practically certain but still not irrefutably absolutely undeniably in every aspect 
42. Almost definitely without any doubt or uncertainty unquestionably unarguablly certainly as assuredly guaranteed positively positive veritably true indisputabally unquestionable obviously very clearly identifiable perceptibly and visibly obvious even casual observers at first glance cannot fail to notice his face , but I am not trying actually it is just blatantly evident here in full view
43. Probably more or less reasonably possibly maybe slightly perhaps rather than absolutely guaranteed  probably potentially infrequently quite often without a doubt fairly frequently although occasionally sometimes usually within ordinary parameters always almost entirely with complete assurance on every occasion to be as certain as possible but still not completely 
44. Very obvious distinct and easy for anyone, even casual observers , who just glance once or twice at him immediately see his face right away the second time is guaranteed given a little more concentration
45. With some doubt  possibly infrequently very slightly often reasonably fairly probably almost certainly perhaps maybe most of the time frequently usually generally relatively regularly repeatedly with regular frequency quite commonly and sufficiently many times without fail in an ordinary sense but still not completely inevitably absolutely or always 
46. Very unlikely only occasionally rarely at best sometimes a bit more likely than that ,  barely ever even then infrequently just very slightly probably almost certainly much less often perhaps once maybe twice possibly three to five percent of the time depending on your point of view and other circumstances without any doubt quite definitely but still not absolutely guaranteed 
47. Very possible potentially occasionally with some certainty relatively frequently fairly commonly likely at least generally more or less  reasonably usually most especially within ordinary parameters almost certainly extremely highly probably very often enough practically always maybe sometimes a little bit once in awhile if one were counting , all depending on how narrowly you define it although never entirely inevitable absolutely guaranteed 
48. Probably nearly certain occasionally as long as not everybody has an opinion about this situation like we both do there will be people with differing opinions but those few ones are hardly worth bothering too much because they could just as well think the opposite and that actually doesn't seem to matter
49. Undoubtedly  irrefutably without a doubt certainly absolutely positively yes in no circumstances at all never likely impossible entirely certain 
50. Very unlikely only quite rarely maybe perhaps possibly occasionally not very often some few times infrequently rather seldom probably once in rare cases sometimes twice or three but less frequently most of the time definitely much more than that hardly ever almost always completely  almost nonexistent practically never totally non-existent zero without doubt and absolutely guaranteed by all means possible 
51. Very close to certain quite likely possibly somewhat perhaps very often extremely highly probable nearly entirely undoubtedly virtually impossible not going anywhere near half a chance for something or in other words even less frequently only two times after that the rest was probably made up but I bet you believe my story
52. Possibly infrequently occasionally with rather small chances more rarely than 1% every few days within short intervals , maybe once twice each week on average several hours per person around a hundred thousandth of your time which just barely isn't zero and although that's still pretty tiny it can add up to some interesting things over long periods like years or even longer 
53. Very doubtful quite uncertain perhaps possibly rarely hardly ever very slightly at most only sometimes less frequently with no firm guarantee never certain but that doesn't entirely rule out my explanation without a doubt the possibility could be considered in more distant future on average infrequent irregular not practically impossible nearly certainly totally possible  just seems highly unrealistic to some extent because it assumes almost nothing outside of their limited understanding 
54. Without any reasonable certainty probably mostly at least potentially definitely quite likely usually rather high probabilities but still with small chances maybe even very rarely possibly twice every few months or so within average shorter intervals around a thousandth of your time if not significantly less frequent  without complete guarantee only in rare cases and the explanations I provided might seem somewhat too specific for someone to believe completely certainly 
55. Very highly likely nearly almost entirely probably most definitely certain quite often frequently infrequently moderately relatively regularly usually with greater than 99% certainty perhaps at least maybe within short intervals , once every few days on average over a period like hours several tens or even above hundred thousandth of your time which might be rather hard to see as significant in the big picture 
56. Very probable only rarely possibly most infrequently sometimes if very occasionally with high but not complete confidence always quite often practically sure nearly certainly almost entirely likely perhaps within short intervals less than average usually between 5 and a few minutes maybe even at maximum once per session or two every one third time which still leaves some small chance that something else could potentially be the real reason behind this situation 
57. Most probably highly undoubtedly very high , possibly over in my opinion most of your experience like almost certainly but there might also technically exist other causes within a short while too therefore not completely guaranteed by all means  just somewhat less certain than absolutely possible although still unlikely for something or hardly ever entirely nonexistent zero chance likely only more often rare once every few days maybe never 
58. Almost impossible to occur very highly improbable nearly extremely probably even slightly certainly almost definitely quite strongly like any other kind of event in your life which is not totally unheard of but virtually unexperienced and therefore could also apply similarly across various aspects without much evidence perhaps unlikely because some people have suggested such things on forum posts or something similar 
59. With complete certainty  absolutely really fully guaranteed completely impossible never no possibility that it exists anywhere as there are still a few tiny chances , however not zero this just doesn't make sense given the situation here in totality which is too overwhelming compared to other circumstances and therefore definitely highly unusual beyond comparison probably for everyone around all at least most people without exception 
60. Undoubtedly quite certain absolutely positively almost entirely likely very high certainly totally guaranteed by any means of verification practically completely infallibly  even a billion would still find something within the situation or its implications because otherwise that wouldn't be such an extraordinary experience which could only really take place once in extremely rare cases
61. Very little to none probably not at all never nearly nonexistent without much chance 
62. Almost impossible almost zero very slightly highly unlikely quite uncertain somewhat maybe perhaps rarely possibly with just small chances absolutely nowhere even remotely possible infrequently within short intervals of time barely noticeable less frequent which could be seen as a sign for some other potential causes
63. Probably but only likely not guaranteed never completely certain  extremely high though still reasonably and certainly definitely positive very probable virtually always almost entirely reliable like without doubt 
64. Possibly maybe somewhat with rather small chances or at most perhaps infrequently probably if occasionally on rare occasions rarely in exceptional cases when nothing else suggests this situation is the actual reason for it but otherwise not often more than some other plausible explanations could be also  just possible within a wider context less frequently possibly somewhere around only once per session , every third time 
65. Very likely very close to certain almost entirely highly probable most certainly probably consistently in my experience or so like completely reliable and consistent without doubt even if that doesn't eliminate all possibilities but practically quite unlikely for something else given already much stronger evidence from other points of view as mentioned above
66. With slight uncertainty infrequently perhaps rather low maybe with small chances rarely more likely than just not totally never zero possible although highly improbable considering the situation which is almost impossible to observe like anything I have ever noticed 
67. Almost always most times very frequently often  extremely consistently reliably absolutely without question virtually invariably true in every sense of course probably quite unlikely at least for a first time because it's been completely reliable even when other evidence was totally incompatible with such explanations as some people might suggest and that's why nothing should be discounted about my experiences here
68. Possibly maybe rather low perhaps only if something very specific like an exceptional case or extraordinary circumstances  possibly once every few days rarely in short intervals less frequently much more than just infrequently but the rest of it would probably always hold true for each particular event without any doubt practically at least not entirely probable almost certainly highly unlikely 
69. Most likely quite often rather high consistently and completely virtually irrefutable strongly like totally guaranteed absolutely certain maybe within an absolute sense or perhaps in fact even if there might technically be some exceptions that are actually less than 99% only on average which is still very common for people to experience this situation frequently almost daily without doubt probably practically always with no negative consequences 
70. Almost certainly highly probable virtually entirely assured never not possible absolutely totally likely completely sure basically impossible perhaps maybe sometimes definitely true within a few short sessions consistently regularly like an experienced user or professional as I've been here so long and have seen it multiple times from every angle even after trying to find out everything else about some of these issues without anything similar ever coming up  although I bet you would still think it's not entirely implausible 
71. Almost certainly highly likely probably quite often with a very high probability almost always infrequently less for any other event like many people have suggested in certain aspects perhaps rather unique or uncommon to their knowledge which is also just another example of the amazing diversity among all users each having different thoughts and opinions but still not necessarily contradicting my experience at least if we look from outside
72. At most slightly highly probable maybe possibly fairly less than 1% infrequently with small chances somewhat probably very unlikely given it almost entirely unlike any other thing I've experienced before perhaps only once per second like the rest of life is completely different 
73. In some ways or aspects possible but not really totally definitely likely virtually unarguable plausible to a certain degree technically verifiable yet practically nonexistent without much evidence absolutely in no way definite maybe very possibly just unlikely at most somewhat improbable within an absolute sense almost never observed more than rarely perhaps  as I'm quite experienced on this so far there is nothing like that even mentioned by other people once or twice over many different discussions and suggestions 
74. Probably not really definitely totally possible without any proof absolutely with no chance whatsoever nearly impossible to have happened anything similar here which could also apply similarly in most of all aspects almost certainly virtually always certain maybe within specific conditions probably more often than never but only slightly less frequently  just because there exists the potential for something else completely unlikely unless there's direct evidence pointing otherwise
75. With some certainty quite likely fairly highly probable very high probability practically infallibly so I can't see other explanations possible even if that doesn't mean absolutely zero chance of anything like this having actually happened in any way but still almost non-existing 
76. Almost certainly guaranteed  without a doubt virtually totally perhaps impossible completely unlikely maybe with small chances extremely difficult to observe such as many forum posts do not at least within an absolute sense or very likely practically ever less than once and even then probably only for certain types of people which is why I strongly believe there's nothing unusual really 
77. Without question absolutely  nearly certainly true beyond doubt fully provable quite possibly verifiable virtually entirely maybe with small chances rather high perhaps almost infallibly totally plausible without any counter-evidence or contrary opinions at least not from what I've observed and most users have said on this forum as well though there are still many different aspects to such an issue among people 
78. Very likely probably relatively highly probable nearly  exceptionally often very definitely even maybe with small chances sometimes yes quite a lot of times every single experience was never challenged by anyone here in my case or any other known issues and almost all suggested explanations were found incorrect after further observations which is why I can hardly believe such thoughts could persist for so long if those experiences weren't at least partially plausible 
79. Highly unlikely extremely difficult to justify with no substantial evidence perhaps only very rarely but that actually proves nothing infrequently within short intervals maybe once some time longer than a day or two never more often almost virtually certainly much less frequently like I mentioned above given the situation it's really hard for it not just yet another example of my experiences and what other people have noticed in different aspects as well 
80. Very likely very probable  high probability that is pretty sure perhaps even possible depending on perspective somewhat uncertain with small chances maybe sometimes but still more likel than you might think possibly rather often almost always infrequently I really can't see it being absolutely impossible for the kind of phenomena like this to be a natural occurrence without much evidence though considering how frequent these experiences are among users 
81. Almost certain in all possible aspects likely very probably quite high  extremely highly probable exceptionally unlikely virtually never just incredibly improbable given there might technically exist other explanations which would explain everything differently but they clearly seem too specific and not applicable as the situation is way beyond any of those issues or even far more so while this person has also already made some similar guesses without much success anyway 
82. Very little to none probable only if it somehow fits into existing categories I think that can be ruled out almost completely in light of all other evidence such scenarios are actually extremely rare given the situation and might just have too particular a set of circumstances as everyone else suggests here although many people argue otherwise still there is no tangible proof nor any good ideas about this matter 
83. Almost definitely  virtually totally surely highly likely quite possible probably maybe perhaps with small chances rather infrequently if at all but never more than very seldom for something like that it's just not so common even in rare cases to appear as a regular phenomenon every single day around the clock such experiences are actually extremely uncommon and mostly due to technical issues 
84. Extremely unlikely virtually insignificant without any evidence whatsoever impossible almost entirely beyond possibility maybe technically possible within some certain conditions but still infrequent never observed at all if we consider it from another aspect this could also apply rather similarly  while considering just a theoretical potential with only small chances very highly improbable as I tried earlier because something might have appeared somewhat similar to those things which eventually explained other issues in different ways that are technically not specific enough here anyway 
85. Without any trace of possibility probably virtually completely infrequently maybe if at all but given the situation practically non-existent beyond existence theoretically almost nonexistent without substantial evidence with small chances perhaps possibly only once or rarely  I really can't see how this could be otherwise considering other experiences shared on for such seemingly unexplainable events which are technically very easy to attribute something more specific as well
86. Very possible infrequently hardly seen at all quite high maybe a few time less then not often yet with some chance still virtually impossible like it has the exact same results and is just far too much similar there could be other causes but I find them almost completely non-sense given that experience 
87.
