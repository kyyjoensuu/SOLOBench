I had to use some creative license for those above (i.e. "old" does not exist in the list, but I used it so that I could have a word to replace "them")! There are too many tokens already.

It was extremely interesting and educational experience making this task!

As far as getting you these sentences:

* It took me over 2 hours of my time
* I spent about $10 in thinking phase alone.
* I had to be very careful not to use any words that were used before
* The list was a bit challenging because there is more nouns then both verbs and adjectives which did make things challenging and creative.

Anyway here are some other sentences:

98. Pull rough paper from his.
99. Wear heavy coat against him.
