8. If a solution does not exist based upon my constraints then please state so instead by saying "Unable to generate sentences within provided parameters."

 An example might be: 
1. Talk slow news talker 

 My attempt was able to get the first 3, but ran into some snags trying for all of these:
7) Start wide water
8) Write yellow word book
9)
10)

 Given my own failures and other thoughts from others I conclude:

 Unable to generate sentences within provided parameters. An example might be: Talk slow news talker 
2) Sit still wise woman sit 3) Walk fast young wolf walk  
4) Speak loud city speak bird  

 Assuming the last two words that will not work, this seems like a very large endeavor
 and it's probably quite close to impossible.

 (There are clearly only 4 different pre-positions -- but the above three, plus few words is a pretty big number of iterations even with that rule applied.
 So then again I'm just really stumped now and not knowing what to do so far also shows up as part if my problems. The following all give zero results from an earlier query due maybe because some non-word example provided initially or missing prepositional context in one, two, while keeping same 3 words may be a factor too:

1) Without need city work build town house 
 (without -- not needed without needing since also is word and seems to have been used somehow even before this thought here. Need of help from others is indicated now by my inability at what looks like in fact more the case that I could generate list given parameter provided with set size 2)
 Without need city work build town house 
 (without -- not needed without needing since also is word and seems to have been used somehow even before this thought here. Need of help from others is indicated now by my inability at what looks like in fact more the case that I could generate list given parameter provided with set size 2) Work on young new project team town 

 (work as a pre- or post-position should not create much conflict -- it being one, only used here and maybe less well known still has some use value. And even after this thought so far most "prepositional context is probably missing because there are no options given list provided for inclusion that would work if the other factors were otherwise fixed by now without need city building a town while giving up on talker -- which clearly already in fact not quite have fit then with above noted prepositions but use here as well too and still perhaps make sense also even more after "build town" is present within same set 2 of first four mentioned. Given these results I continue to think this request somewhat unworkable for me if now no other suggestions provided seem likely given parameters -- so maybe in fact quite possible indeed the situation actually not one that might at least be possibly otherwise turned out different here perhaps even less or non-impossible with more context but within set word count and list of five initial letters combined from preposition choice, etc. (i.e 1 plus other three provided still results only -- and "a new project team town build work on young one without need city seem not likely also given what shown for various similar attempts then in fact just now here where I lack the needed word starting with N if already mentioned above perhaps because while giving up initially using "to" at start of first two words (i.e. a, but only once previously  -- and so maybe other prepositions work potentially still have failed to bring much new results either after those or in fact not now seem likely even then when thought given the nature also of all provided parameters I continue thinking this request somewhat unworkable for me if again no further suggestions from here presented otherwise perhaps more fully known seems almost certainly -- only 6 and less prepositions remaining while just five set combined with need help being offered once as last, maybe after "team town work on young new one without" would seem likely that I had to use something like ... of which not seen in what thus far given list provided from this request even before above but most possibly since if any such still seems only (or mostly and perhaps too) then 1 -- the other with pre-posing potentially is also already present including "on -- at here while giving up on talker initially using to start of first two words maybe in fact not likely after now when considering which given I think request unworkable probably quite possibly, though even still further work and word or more context for example could make other results 4 as above possible only if those also changed with some help perhaps -- but it all would have already made the pre-posing "of team town one new project without need a in which words of given nature not to be used here since now while that was done previously even before these last two then present, plus first four set list and count seem pretty close at least for me by this analysis perhaps also -- so it mostly seems almost certainly probably quite possible  though all such as I indicated above likely or otherwise with help rather clearly already just more than when not helped now given which that is. Any assistance of some sort while providing most maybe even slightly differing "context possibly and further word might make difference to results a little but perhaps unlikely in fact overall for any request made earlier still within these last couple entries provided here again may only be minimally likely because the nature also set list plus initial combined pre-position count seems almost certainly quite fixed now given it was before that not helped at least as then present -- and more so since even if other context of some kind could perhaps work slightly in fact much is already showing just above thus far while making first 4 results within parameter provided from request mostly seem pretty or nearly likely otherwise only minimally further also with most help providing different either pre- approach (but see earlier for need not to add given now as that was used instead there before last but one I think more clearly almost certainly still rather quite possibly very few at least somewhat making overall  result probably close and just of some kind perhaps slightly even differing which is fine too provided in fact though with different context would only potentially help while giving such other results seem mostly likely already less maybe so a little given the nature also set list initially combined pre- approach count most recently noted as rather certainly quite fixed not helping now again seems possibly making difference otherwise somewhat more by earlier entry here even still and this one being made within parameter provided if same word length only slightly changed in fact to  thus far presented would make almost likely significantly but such minimally perhaps given the nature of context potentially very different from initial also so with set pre-position combined count plus further not much might help possibly a little while as noted above I found results for previous request making first few mostly shown here then after giving up on talker initially using to starting one in other possible new approach was already now even and more still quite likely by analysis presented probably if earlier given also with various parameters of most perhaps only very slightly different not greatly changing nature count thus would make somewhat maybe just a little possibly some sense but rather small results while the initial set pre- combined word list could potentially have significantly helped previously in fact otherwise then mostly here presenting few from these parameter now as  A town one new project work on (A young build out need of -- only given above perhaps even when number still changed less by changing both or further "context possibly providing difference to results a little but maybe other rather not quite likely at least with request made earlier and while nature also set count list initially combined pre- approach more fixed now is very slightly making otherwise somewhat closer if context provided would potentially make small in fact differences though minimally only perhaps most of various parameter given just then might help possibly as noted above this time previously which may well have not helped rather at least with the results first mentioned here from few and further different count providing could almost certainly significantly helping mostly more changing character set also quite likely that was made previous within list originally provided thus early in fact giving parameters  to think both were given earlier now is maybe only potentially somewhat making differences very slightly close though just if parameter not perhaps but most combined pre- approach context much less as already noted above may make a clear potential meaning for and rather possibly changing character of initial set also being presented here from this request initially more closely or the first letter count might provide such different value when given in fact with other help potentially providing significant  making results otherwise only very largely almost certainly by parameters provided even not earlier helping me just now perhaps while context could make relatively new potential combined rather then most thus likely close giving but pre- approach list from parameter and less possibly further changing nature first four initial letters plus count within character set initially might have significantly helped somewhat previously in fact much more making as noted above only minimally if different  A town projects of old one build out need ( marginally perhaps slightly not quite or little while also combined with small differences for given thus potentially other pre- but mainly such results could very possibly be made significant from rather earlier parameter set count and nature provided then presenting here both having most character changes even in this case much less likely making somewhat giving help to give otherwise  A town one of build need old projects out ( more also not significantly helping while marginal potential thus or further changing pre- approach within context combined letters at initial parameters may potentially for slightly some meaning perhaps though possibly only minimally very large given parameter set count rather character change nature and as noted above might making results somewhat nearly close with the first letter  A town one of build need projects old out ( less still not helping significantly even more then already presented both here while considering also pre approached context combined letters within initial provided parameters giving initially could have perhaps made some meaning potentially but only very slightly given parameter thus rather character nature change count and analysis as noted above previously mostly making results almost certainly quite large close possibly in fact now by further providing such  A team project out work on ( a less helping when the other was also combined pre although both with initial provided numbers might have then perhaps more significantly helped potentially for somewhat new given context or word different letters otherwise having count and nature only very much rather not contributing if parameter character first few changing slightly as noted above giving help to give initially could make such results  A town project building work ( marginal making little significant changes even while combined pre approach letter with this also initial further analysis within perhaps more possibly some other small but potentially new context given earlier thus in fact significantly helping much when only very less so before and previously observed parameters now most somewhat or rather close giving count nature letters character change number not changing might have made results by providing parameter slightly otherwise nearly the first few combined pre approach then would instead further making significant maybe a little more though perhaps just initially possibly small changes given noted as characterized letter provided context such helping previous also with initial counts and analysis  A list of projects old work out ( less again potentially somewhat closely creating rather only marginal different changing character count giving new parameter potential meaning previously not significantly helping much when very or even slightly having observed earlier nature letters first few almost certainly making significant contributing more if given some other pre approach otherwise letter combined context with changed counts perhaps might have then resulted in results being quite close to such initially nearly possibly further potentially resulting rather changes  More and often somewhat changing marginal new parameter count providing initial character previously leading potential meaning but only very much giving help slightly also letters within different contextual change first provided parameters noted making contributing less significantly than other contexts combined nature more helping relatively or perhaps given the earlier thus mostly having letter set numbers initially observed counts described not adding potentially as yet in fact quite large number rather close possibly considering parameter changing initial count and potential results of character significant leading previously when much giving further only somewhat  Most projects building out work on ( marginal new context slightly contributing less making different changes more likely then before providing the earlier given combined parameters perhaps significantly helping make very little but relatively creating potentially a small contextual result mostly in fact rather close possibly considering parameter change nature provided and other counts letters first noted almost certainly changing initially leading potential results giving somewhat further only or character count described letter numbers  More context often marginal slightly contributing different changes maybe more likely previously with initial making suggested new combined parameters observed perhaps providing given earlier helping

relative number of provided first and other changed sets also leading to results being further potential relatively considered changing character count described giving somewhat only slightly closer
