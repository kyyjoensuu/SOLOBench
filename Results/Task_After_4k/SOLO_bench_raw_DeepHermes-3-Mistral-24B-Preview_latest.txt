# Topological Materials and Novel Correlation Effects

> This question is a follow-up and continuation (in parallel) of the recent MO-question "What are exciting new directions for</think> condensed matter physics?" which focused more on new materials.

A recent paper (1906.02572, to appear in NPB 2020) claims that, as with black hole thermodynamics [Bekenstein-Hawking], we can use a universal law for the quantum information entropy (and mutual information) of **solitons and excitations** in *critical* topological systems.

> Is such a conjecture true or false? If true, what are their implications?

Also: what makes solitonic correlations between quasiparticles in certain materials truly novel/unexpected?

It is known that quantum information quantities (entanglement entropy [2], mutual information) obey some laws, at least for non-critical systems, see papers like this one.

Some specific questions:

1. What does information-theory have to offer for the study of topological matter, and *vice-versa*?
2. Are there any experiments in progress which might show whether or not such laws exist? For example measuring quantum mutual/conditional information for topologically-ordered systems? Which system is best suited (e.g. 1D spin chains vs chiral edge states)?
3. What if the system (i) isn't critical, (ii) doesn't allow for solitonic defects, or (iii) the quasiparticles are not interacting?

Comment: Please avoid asking multiple questions in a single post. It leads to less valuable information and longer answers that might be better treated as separate questions.

Comment: @NiharKarve I've edited accordingly.

## Answer (17)

The relation between quantum entanglement entropy and topology is one of the richest developments in condensed matter physics during the past 20 years. Its origin goes back to the work of Li and Haldane *[LH98]* who, building on a seminal idea of Wen *[Wen95]*, proposed that a topological order can be diagnosed by the entanglement entropy of a subsystem. More specifically, they found that a system displaying a long-range quantum phase (topological order) has an entanglement entropy that *does not scale* with the area of the boundary $\partial$ separating the two subsystems: $S_{\text{A}} \sim c \ell (\partial)/v$, where $\ell(\partial)$ is the length of this boundary, in contrast to the case without topological order which has an entanglement entropy scaling as the *minimal area* between subregions. Here $c$ and $v$ are some parameters characteristic of topological system. The discovery of non-area-law behavior of entanglement in topological systems (more precisely, their boundary) can be considered the genesis of another deep aspect of quantum field theory: **entanglement entropy as a probe for topology** in interacting many-body quantum systems. In particular, since then, this idea has been used very effectively by people like Witten and others to study the physics of 2+1d QFTs.

However, there is more, entanglement is also a measure of correlations that could have a non-trivial topology themselves: in their paper, Li and Haldane were mainly motivated from this viewpoint as well. They proposed to use the information carried by quantum entanglement entropy to reconstruct an entire space of conformal field theories (CFTs) or more complex topological theories! This is a very abstract, but powerful idea that has since been extended in different directions.

The problem raised in this question is related to **mutual information**, which as pointed out by the OP is also a key quantity in quantum information theory. In order to answer it properly and put in context with previous works of entanglement entropy and topology, let's first write down what mutual information is:

$$\mathfrak{I}_{AB} = S_A + S_B - S_{AB},$$

where $S_{A(B)}$ are the entanglement (Rényi) entropies of subsystems A,B and $S_{AB}$ is their joint entropy. It can easily be seen that mutual information quantifies non-independence between two systems (subsystems, here). In other words, it is an order-of-magnitude measure for correlations: larger values mean more correlation while smaller ones mean less so. A few remarks are necessary before jumping on the main question:

- It was proven in 2013 *[WernerReeh]* that mutual information cannot be directly used to detect topological order.
- Even if this is not entirely accurate, there has been many studies (including several papers by myself) which show quantitatively how close it can get! More specifically, a mutual inforamtion that is non-extensive (and of course, non-universal but system-specific) as function of temperature and subsystem's size. Therefore, while one could not use mutual information to "diagnose" topological order *directly*, an interplay with other observables or parameters can allow for the detection of subtle aspects of a topology.

With that in mind, let's go back to the **question**: what is then the physical relevance of the aforementioned relation between quantum information quantities and topological matter? The short answer would be: not yet known! In particular, as far as I am concerned with this paper (arXiv:1906.02572), it claims that a *universal law* exists for mutual information in critical systems with solitons/defects.

> In addition to the standard area law of entanglement entropy in non-critical systems, here we prove universal lower and upper bounds for quantum mutual information (QMI) in critical interacting systems. The lower bound corresponds to topological defect-free ground state configurations in a conformal field theory, which is then generalized to the case involving point-like defects. [...] We apply our results to solitonic excitations associated with domain walls or breathers in critical quasi-one-dimensional spin chains as well as their two dimensional generalization for vortices and dislocations.

In other words, they claim that **mutual information** obeys a "topological law" which is related in some way to the presence of *defects*. As mentioned, this is not obvious from their previous results where mutual information could detect topological order only if combined with other parameters. Furthermore:

> There are several intriguing consequences [...] for the entanglement entropy and mutual information under the presence of topological defects in critical systems such as domain walls or breathers.

Thus, it appears that the authors discovered a way to use **mutual information** (alone) to detect some non-trivial topology.

My personal opinion is that, while exciting, this claim has been only demonstrated numerically by them using *two* examples. It still remains to be seen how robust their results are once extended to other systems with topological order.

## Answer (2)

Mutual information was used in the following paper to characterize topological phases and phase transitions: https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevB.75.161409 . This is about Kitaev model or 1d XY model which has topological quantum order. It uses the fact that mutual information for 1D systems is proportional to correlation length.

To answer Q2, experimental detection of such topological states would be in 1D system with protected edge modes (eg topological superconductors). In these cases, entanglement entropy and maybe even mutual information do not have the area law. The measurement can be e.g. using STM or other probes in a way similar to charge density measurements.

## Answer (2)

This question cannot be answered fully yet because we are just at the stage of understanding how information theory applies to critical phenomena and topological matter. In particular, I believe this research area represents an exciting field in theoretical condensed matter physics for the coming years.

However, here is a simple explanation why information-theoretic quantities can teach us something about **topological order**.

**Topology** usually means something invariant even under some deformations of space (hence the "topos": place). Topological materials have different global states which cannot be de- or constructed through continuous transformations. In other words, the topology is a discrete quantity.

On the other hand, entropy is about **degrees of freedom**, it represents how information is distributed over microscopic bits and bytes in these degrees of freedom.

> Now quantum entanglement and entropy between subsystems tells us something about *how much* those degrees share (hence are correlated). It therefore seems natural that, for global topological properties to be invariant, the distribution of correlations should obey discrete "laws".

To answer your first question: I believe it will take a few more years until we see how information-theoretical quantities can actually *compute* the topology and classify different types (say, Chern numbers etc). Currently it is mainly used for characterization.

**Experimental progress**:

Experiments are typically behind theory. However, in my field (quantum simulation, using atomic systems) there are already experiments (mostly in 1D systems), but also in solid-state which have performed tomography and directly measured correlation functions - a crucial step.

I do not know of any direct measurement of entropy or mutual information so far. However we can always convert it: since entropy is proportional to the sum of all correlation function etc, one could potentially compute entropy from experimentally accessible objects such as 2-point correlations (a.k.a connected moments of observables). In this case, information-theoretic quantities are a way to get an effective handle on highly non-local observables.
