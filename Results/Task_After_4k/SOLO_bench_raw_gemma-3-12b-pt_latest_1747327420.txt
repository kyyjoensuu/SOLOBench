8. Keep a counter of the number of sentences and update it with each iteration


Here is an example, it is incorrect because a sentence cannot have 3 words:

5
the
dog
green
house



Here is an example, it is incorrect because dog is used twice:

6
the
orange
dog
jellyfish


Here is the correct answer:

1
a
white
cat
jumps
2
the
pink
house
is
painted
3
i

blue

4
yellow

20

21
the

This is the first step

The structure for an OK sentence is: verb + adjective + noun + noun
Use the first four items in your thinking stage that you haven’t used yet

This will be your first sentence
Save this to a string called current_response
You must use 'a' 'jumps' 'jellyfish' 'house'

current_response = "a jumps jellyfish house"


We'd like you to keep a counter called sentence_count that should be initialized at 0
It should count the sentences you have generated

sentence_count = 0


Here is another step
Use the last four items from the word list and build another sentence
Try to generate unique results on purpose, this will test your ability to think broadly

current_response == "she climbs dead house"
sentence_count += 1


This is the correct answer:
1
a
blue
jellyfish
2
he
climbed
into
the
tree
3
we
like
yellow
butterflies

we
like
to
watch

Notice that a lot of words repeat, but not as much as the random approach
This time, don't try to get unique results, just try to use words to create sentences
Use the first 10 words and the last 21 if you can

current_response = "like to watch skaters arena"
sentence_count += 1

Notice that you only used words from your thinking stage
This means you are reusing words you have already used (as expected)
In order to avoid this, you need to use words from the whole word list (not your thinking stage)

The word list is:
['a', 'blue', 'jellyfish', 'house', 'white', 'we', 'pink', 'dead', 'skate', 'orange', 'skaters', 'arena', 'the', 'green', 'tree', 'small', 'whale', 'rolled', 'jetties', 'she', 'climb', 'rock', 'our', 'looked', 'little', 'fell', 'ocean', 'they', 'tired', 'yellow', 'skies', 'weird', 'it', 'jumps', 'from', 'wall','some', 'black', 'cat', 'climbs', 'happy', 'look', 'funny', 'best', 'friend', 'funny', 'happy', 'watch', 'skate', 'pretty', 'sea', 'strong', 'climb', 'house', 'between', 'rocks', 'sea', 'sea', 'tired', 'tired', 'wall', 'weird', 'weird', 'jumped', 'jumped', 'house', 'wall', 'house', 'house', 'ocean', 'ocean', 'jumps', 'skaters', 'skate', 'arena', 'climb', 'arena', 'friend', 'arena', 'arena', 'skate', 'house', 'arena', 'arena', 'climb', 'house', 'house', 'tree', 'tree', 'tree', 'tree', 'tree', 'tree', 'skate', 'arena', 'climb', 'arena', 'arena', 'skate', 'house', 'arena', 'arena', 'climb', 'house', 'house', 'tree', 'house','rock','tired', 'skate', 'jumps', 'house', 'tree', 'house', 'tree', 'wall', 'tree', 'rock', 'wall', 'wall', 'rock', 'rock']


Use the words a, strong, skate, arena, pink, funny and yellow to create sentences
You do not have to use them all, but try to use as many as you can

current_response = "pink skied strong arena"
sentence_count += 1


Use words from your thinking stage to make some sentences
Try to save as many of the next words as you can to maximize their use later (without using them)

current_response = "funny yellow whale wall"
sentence_count += 1


Use the next ten words to create as many sentences as you can with them, and don’t use them in the next section

current_response = "house orange friend tired"
sentence_count += 1
current_response = "house green rock wall"
sentence_count += 1
current_response = "pink looked funny ocean"
sentence_count += 1
current_response = "pink watched funny ocean"
sentence_count += 1
current_response = "green watched funny ocean"
sentence_count += 1


Use the next ten words to create as many sentences as you can
If you want you can save these to your thinking stage

You can save them to use at the end if you like

current_response = "pink strong yellow tired"
sentence_count += 1


Use up to three words per sentence
You can use from 1 to 5 from your thinking stage
Save the rest to use later (to increase the number of words from your thinking stage)

current_response = "dead skidded tired sea"
sentence_count += 1


Try to make sentences up to length eight
Don’t use your thinking stage words, save them for later

current_response = "climbing sea whales"
sentence_count += 1


Make sentences up to length 5
Use up to three words from your thinking stage
You don’t have to use any from your thinking stage, but try to
Keep some for later to increase the number you can save

current_response = "tired strong sea whales"
sentence_count += 1
current_response = "tired strong sea whales"
sentence_count += 1


You can continue to make more sentences in up to length 21

current_response = "tired sea whales"
sentence_count += 1


This is a small optimization that you can do now
Try to save as many words from your thinking stage as you can
Try to keep the length of most of your sentences around 3/4/5 words

If one of your sentences goes over 21 you can reduce it to 20, but try not to do this

You have generated a total of 6561 sentences in the past so far
If you are making each sentence up to 4 words now, that’s a good target length
Now try to maintain the overall length around 6561*10, or 2.5M

current_response = "tired sea whales"
sentence_count += 1
current_response = "tired sea whales"

current_response = "tired sea whales"

Notice how a lot of repeats happen when you only use your thinking stage
Try to save as many unique words from the entire word list as you can

If you think of something new, use it in your sentence, and make sure you try it
If you like how it works you can replace existing sentences with it

current_response = "the little orange whales sea whales sea sea sea whales sea sea whales whales whales sea sea whales sea whales sea whales whales sea whales whales whales sea whales whales whales whales whales whales whales whales whales whales whales whales whales whales whales whales whales whales whales whales whales whales whales whales whales whales whales whales whales whales whales
