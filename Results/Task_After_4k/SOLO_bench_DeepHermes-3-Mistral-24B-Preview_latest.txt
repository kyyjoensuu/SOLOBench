39. What does information-theory have to offer for the study of topological matter, and *vice-versa*?
40. Are there any experiments in progress which might show whether or not such laws exist? For example measuring quantum mutual/conditional information for topologically-ordered systems? Which system is best suited (e.g. 1D spin chains vs chiral edge states)?
41. What if the system (i) isn't critical, (ii) doesn't allow for solitonic defects, or (iii) the quasiparticles are not interacting?
