 that follows these rules above.

Start:
1. Try my best hope teacher student.
2. Look tiny bird sky blue high up there.
3. See old book green interesting story inside.
4. Give young girl brown toy very gently she plays with it all day long until her family leaves the house when they go out for a trip every single evening during each month of summer as well on days that weather is clear, but especially if someone forgets to pack his blue umbrella because he does not really feel like bringing such heavy rain gear which only makes sense in case she should get lost and nobody knows about her whereabouts.
5. Watch big clock yellow very loud near the playground when school starts so they have one last minute before teachers run down there with their little groups of students to start making everyone line up for lunch at 11:00 without much talking it just happens on all kinds of days like regular, weekdays and even during holidays or weekends as well including rainy ones.
6. Sing old song orange red from school when children learn many different instruments some playing guitar while others are using trumpets they play a musical performance every few years whenever one group feels inspired to bring the music outside such that it echoes throughout their neighborhood on days of special gatherings too but mostly this is done once at 7 pm for an hour each day during summer as if somehow in everyone's mind everyone remembered exactly what had happened so long ago.
7. Read white book interesting blue stories inside where most people prefer spending time after a school ends when they feel really bored because there isn't much else to do the moment one of them gets home at 3:30 pm even though usually some children continue going outside until around sunset then have very little energy left instead and as for those who are older that would only come near the beginning or end with their favorite movie, it might happen once each year in June but they mostly just watch sports without really being able to sit on a couch during these times.
8. Write big story short green light while cars drive around then almost everyone has no choice either even though people have many possible stories that never get the chance of hearing since someone always finds them interesting or another person wants something different from one day every year because they are too preoccupied with some event like New Year's Eve celebration on January 1st which isn't really a holiday at all, but rather just happens almost daily and only takes place early in most cases even though sometimes people think more deeply instead.
9. Look old yellow light when clouds go dark it changes very little for many children because they have no control to make the change take away from their fun so that every night or morning a group of them will talk about how this never really happens then just like once in 10 years, though not exactly but often after school.
10. Say small story long red sun brightly when people feel cold suddenly one should get his jacket on because it is late and the weather changed from nice to cool quickly which might happen any day of a summer season as well without having very much warning beforehand; there are few times that would be enough however like once in 200 years or only during fall instead.
