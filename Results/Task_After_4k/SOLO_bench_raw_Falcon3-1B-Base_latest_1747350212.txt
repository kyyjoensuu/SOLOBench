Example: 
The teacher *appeared* calm and composed at her desk for the first class of the day, as if preparing herself to teach effectively, which was a relief from after weeks of tension in the classroom. The students looked expectantly at their teacher, who seemed ready to provide some valuable insights.  <(feeling, composure) <calm</adjective> <quietly</noun>
(Example) He *struggled* with his equations as he attempted to solve the next problem. His mind was muddled over concepts which he had yet to grasp and could not get far on it. But luckily for him there was someone around who knew what he was up against, if only just enough time to seek help before making a disastrous decision which could lead down an irreversible path of failure and defeat.  <(struggling, comprehension )> <(effortful, confused>
(Example) The students had been quietly reading their assignments when someone shouted out the answer. Everyone knew that the question was straightforward but one student hesitated and didn't know what to do? So he asked the teacher to clarify it. Once the question started to clear up in his head that helped a lot.  <(help, understand> <answering>, <(question, unclear)>
(Example) With the last class of the day I had a lot on my mind as I reflected about what I taught today and about what was happening inside me emotionally after having seen my student struggle because he had no answer to a question. And I realized it had nothing to do with not understanding something. It simply meant that he just needed some patience, time and encouragement before he could understand the lesson fully enough.  <(reflect upon, emotions )>

Example: The students were silent as they listened quietly to their teacher's explanations for a moment before getting up and working on their homework. After class everyone congratulated him on the great work he was doing and thanked him for his help.  (listening) (thank)

Example: When I walk into the office, my eyes see that there're new packages behind the door which we received from our supplier recently or some other supplies I've run out of lately.  (sees, packages, receipt,) And on top of that I have a pile of boxes waiting to be stacked in their proper places and organized in their shelves. My feet go into the hall where there are other departments or sections of the building with different tasks such as cleaning, repairing parts, assembling products etc. and I move from the office and start heading towards one of them which has new orders coming soon, like our clients and I have to make sure they get accurate delivery instructions for their invoices, deadlines, quantity orders based on stock levels or even request for returns if required.  (going) (moves to, office, receive, packing, receive, customer)

Example: My daughter has grown up in an environment where her mother was very strict but also loving and kind. She was taught that if anything went wrong, it had to be fixed right away so she learned how to manage her emotions by taking deep breaths or counting backwards from ten.  (growing) (mothers, strict, loves, kind)

Example: When we got home after a long day of work I always took some time out to sit at my desk and think about the things that went well during the day along with the challenges or obstacles encountered while executing tasks related to achieving our goals. I made sure not to dwell too much on negative aspects or criticize myself for any mistakes made, instead recognizing them as learning opportunities that will help us improve in certain areas moving forward.  (thinking). 

Example: Our company recently celebrated its hundredth anniversary which meant that everyone was busy celebrating together doing various activities such as meetings, brainstorming sessions, project presentations etc. While we were focused on enjoying ourselves during the celebration we had time for some downtime too where everybody could recharge themselves mentally or just relax without worrying about any other responsibilities outside of work until next year’s celebrations come around again.  (celebrating)

Example: When my friend was going through a difficult period emotionally she started finding healthy outlets for her feelings such as journaling, art therapy sessions which helped her express herself more freely instead of keeping everything inside. It allowed her to let off steam gradually without letting stress pile up causing negative effects on mental health over time if left unchecked.  (find out)

Example: When we go shopping at the grocery store I usually scan items one by one looking for something specific such as fruits or vegetables and try to remember exactly what brand they are from their packaging so that when I pick them up next time I won't accidentally pick up another kind of fruit (or vegetable!) which would create some issues later down the line because my previous purchase may have been contaminated with allergens or harmful bacteria etc.  (mark)
    
Example: After reading through those articles on how to write a book, I decided to begin writing today. Since the deadline is approaching soon and I want to finish early enough to submit it before the publisher cancels my manuscript 's due date-time & day; if not they are bound not to give me any royalties then because my editor keeps changing his schedule which makes finding time for revisions every week extremely challenging yet impossible sometimes.  (finish)
   
Example: Having just spent hours researching various topics before deciding on one article topic after another, I finally settled down after reading through countless articles online and came across some helpful tips for aspiring writers which helped immensely in getting started on my own writing piece. Once I began drafting and editing parts of it, it became increasingly clear that something wasn't quite right about the way certain sections were combined together making them difficult to read aloud due to lack cohesion among ideas presented in different paragraphs (chapters).  
    
Example: Since being laid off from my job during the pandemic and struggling both financially as a single parent trying out for new positions at different companies without any prospects or job offers so far- I am desperate to start over again but don't know where to begin with getting hired which gives me pause when thinking about whether or not hiring processes go efficiently since everyone has lost motivation due to work burnout already.  (get)
    
Example: While watching TV on Sunday night after a particularly intense day full of anxiety and fear because we got caught in traffic back home while commuting, I couldn’t help myself from binge-watching all the latest episodes back-to-back which ended up becoming quite engrossing and therapeutic until only a few hours later.  (watch)

Example: When planning dinner for our family of four I always try to incorporate something new every week such as learning how to make sushi rolls or experimenting with different spices which enhances my kitchen skills significantly so that once we decide what dish to prepare together, cooking it becomes easier now compared before.  Example: The way she handled her situation left me curious about the reason behind it- since she never told me directly but indirectly conveyed her frustration towards certain rules or regulations set by authorities such as those imposed on athletes participating in sports events like Olympics where they need approval every four years just to participate again afterwards so she decided not to reveal anything more until now.  (explain)

Example: My son has always been passionate about animals since he was very young and his favorite pastime over the last few months apart from spending quality time playing video games has become hunting wild birds with him using homemade traps built by hand rather than relying on store-bought bait or hooks which made it much more enjoyable experience and rewarding accomplishment personally for him too given how dedicated he is towards learning bird identification skills accurately enough so that even after years of practice his accuracy rating keeps increasing steadily over time until eventually reaching expert level.  (love)
    
Example: After reading through some books on gardening techniques I thought perhaps growing my own vegetables would bring peace to both our minds especially during these challenging times surrounded by many stresses surrounding us daily such as financial hardships caused by job loss along with health concerns related to COVID-19 pandemic especially if we had kids living at home so why not make use of natural resources available around us like sunlight and soil instead of chemical fertilizers which could potentially harm plant growth or contaminate fresh produce consumed thus far without realizing that there's another option worth exploring called organic gardening.  
            
Example: As part of preparation for her midterm exams she spent three weeks studying various subjects ranging from physics concepts to literature analysis methodologies- during this time alone she discovered hidden talents within herself beyond academics such as photography and journaling where initially seeing pictures taken by others made her feel uncomfortable due to lack of personal touch attached behind each frame she captured since no human interaction happened physically unlike traditional methods usually followed in schools thus teaching valuable lessons on self expression through creativity without judgment or criticism from authorities.  
              
Example: When I see the news on TV late at night before going back home late that evening after exhausting activities involving exercise routines and workout sessions over the past few weeks- sometimes leaving me feeling exhausted physically and emotionally because of high levels of anxiety triggered by watching horrific footage showing violent acts inflicted upon innocent civilians killed randomly all around the world causing unnecessary suffering no matter how trivial individual incidents like car accidents or natural disasters appear insignificant when compared with larger conflicts happening simultaneously across continents involving multiple armed groups competing against each other using advanced technology weapons etc.- but still we must continue learning from past failures until finally finding ways to prevent similar tragedies being repeated again and again.

Example: My daughter has always been passionate about animals since she was very young and her favorite pastime over the last few weeks involved playing with stuffed toys stuffed with different types of animals like cats and dogs. Sometimes, she got frustrated when she couldn’t understand why some creatures had such distinct shapes and sizes but would become calm once she understood how they helped maintain balance in nature- which intrigued her so much that now she is learning about zoology online for fun!

Example: As part of preparation for her midterm exams, my daughter spent three weeks studying various subjects ranging from physics concepts to literature analysis methodologies at an educational institution. During this period, she discovered hidden talents within herself beyond academics such as photography and journaling where initially she felt frustrated when struggling to grasp particular subjects but became fascinated once she saw how creatures had shaped our environment positively affecting soil fertility. This interest led her to now learn about entomology through online platforms.  
             (Note: please edit for proper grammar and spelling).
Example: My daughter has always been passionate about animals since she was very young and even as a child, she loved going on adventures exploring local parks searching for various species they were known for- such as squirrels scampering up trees bushes while birds chirped melodiously amongst them. She later joined a zoology club where she spent weekends attending lectures led by experts sharing valuable insights regarding wildlife conservation issues worldwide threatening many endangered creature species due to habitat loss and climate change.  
            Then came finals, midterms, and especially the dreaded final exam all rolled up into one deadline forcing me apart from her side of things- leaving us both feeling exhausted yet accomplished after successfully acing every question tested throughout those months filled with endless revision sessions under dimmed lights studying scientific facts about marine ecosystems facing unprecedented pressure due to pollution affecting their survival rates drastically!  
            (Note: please edit for proper grammar and spelling).  

Example: My daughter has always been passionate about animals since she was young. She loves going on outdoor adventures together where they observe different animal species living peacefully in their environment. Recently, they began volunteering at a local wildlife rehabilitation center where she helps care for injured animals before releasing them back into the wild when possible. This experience gave her an understanding of how delicate the natural balance is and motivated her to spread awareness about environmental concerns impacting countless animal lives today.

Example: During our last family vacation several years ago, my wife found herself stranded in a remote area during a severe storm without cell service or any nearby towns' amenities offering immediate rescue options- leaving only natural resources around her as sustenance until rescued later. Throughout this entire situation, both my husband and I relied heavily on teamwork and resourcefulness skills we learned from spending many days camping trips together which made surviving such harsh weather conditions relatively simple compared to what other families might expect when facing similar situations nowadays. After crossing the entire distance of that vast wilderness terrain in several hours using simple tools like ropes and pulleys fashioned mainly out of old fishing lines we cut earlier while fishing earlier.
