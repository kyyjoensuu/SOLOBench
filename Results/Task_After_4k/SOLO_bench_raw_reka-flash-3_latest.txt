Good luck!''', 

The assistant's response should strictly follow these rules. The example given shows:
Example Input:
word_list = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
example_output:
1. Eat fresh apple banana.
Wait, that's not correct because it violates the structure Verb + Adjective + Noun + Noun, so that invalid.

But the actual correct output would be:
1. Eat fresh apple cherry.

So please adhere to the structure strictly.

Now, given that, let me provide the actual input word list as specified and ask you to generate the sentences accordingly.
