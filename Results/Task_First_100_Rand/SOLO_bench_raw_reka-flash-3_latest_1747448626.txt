Start thinking:
I need to create 200 sentences using specific words from the given list without repeating any. Let me start by understanding the structure: Verb + Adjective + Noun + Noun. Each sentence must follow this pattern exactly.

First, I'll go through the word list and categorize them into verbs, adjectives, nouns. Wait, some words can be both verbs and nouns. For example, "make" is a verb, but could it also be a noun? The problem says to use exactly as they appear in the list, so I need to figure out which category each belongs to. But maybe the instructions imply that each word can only serve one role in the sentences. Hmm, this might complicate things.

Looking at the structure, verbs should come first. So let's list all possible verbs from the word list. The verbs include: relieve, random, news, threshold, inspector, cooperative, accounting, ship, impression, average, differ, brown, game, reason, sanction, giant, unexpected, theme, post, move, cheap, eleven, off, car, bias, sustain, tolerate, context, invite, arrow, guarantee, novel, partly, height, bloody, tall, former, wherever, penalty, Iraqi, know, voting, lend, criticism, size, substantial, something, finding, hostile, lawmaker, ought, feed, citizen, friend, consequently, decade, agency, assure, colonial, modify, every, medium, comparable, infant, educate, celebration, line, superior, floor, treat, identify, duty, ten, adjustment, harassment, graduation, alliance, useful, quality, Thanksgiving, straw, self, equal, democracy, desk, closer, loot, reference to refugee, bedroom, sigh, mask, place, provide, package, interaction, specify, snap, trading, enemy, square, republicman, right, conception, priority, divide, native, scream, appearance, wealthy, row, cycle, philosophy, dragon, premise, restrict, bowl, executive, steak, faith, his, button, country, anger, progress, joy, wire, export, operation, mill, disclose, barely, turn, make, vessel, pole, several, wrap, assist, driving, cram, quarrel, prison, prolong.

Wait, some of these might be nouns. For example, "ship" is a noun but "move" is a verb. The challenge here is to correctly assign each word to its correct part of speech to fit the structure. Maybe I should cross-reference the words with their possible meanings. Let's take "news": that's a noun, so it can't be a verb here. So verbs are actions like make, assist, driving, etc.

Alternatively, perhaps some words can act as both verbs and adjectives, but in this context, they need to fit into the required slots. For example, "random" is an adjective, so maybe it can't be a verb here. Similarly, "brown" is an adjective. So verbs must come from words that are primarily verbs.

Looking through the list again, possible verbs: make, assist, driving, cram, quarrel, prison, prolong, etc. Wait, but some of these might be nouns. For example, "prison" is a noun, so it can't be a verb here. Similarly, "prolong" is a verb (to lengthen). So perhaps the verbs are: make, assist, driving, cram, quarrel, prison (wait, no, prison is a noun), maybe "useful" is an adjective. Hmm.

This is getting complicated. Maybe I need to proceed differently. Let me start by listing out all possible verbs from the word list:

- assist
- cram
- driving
- making (but "make" is present)
- quarrel
- prison (no, that's a noun)
- prolong (verb form: "prolonged")
- etc.

Wait, perhaps I need to look up each word's part of speech. Since I can't use tools, I have to rely on my memory. For example:

- assist: verb
- cram: verb (to study quickly)
- driving: present participle of drive (verb)
- make: verb
- quarrel: verb (argue)
- prison: noun
- prolong: verb

So verbs from the list: assist, cram, driving, make, quarrel, prolong, etc.

Now adjectives: words like random, average, brown, tall, bloody, cooperative, cheap, comparable, substantial, former, partly, self, equal, wealthy, angry, joyous, rectangular (no, not in list), square (can be adjective), etc.

Nouns: ship, news, threshold, inspector, accounting, game, reason, sanction, giant, enemy, theme, post, car, bias, context, invite, arrow, guarantee, novel, impression, height, mask, place, package, interaction, specify, snap, trading, refugee, bedroom, sigh, straw, desk, closer, loot, bowl, executive, steak, faith, button, country, wire, export, operation, mill, disclosure, barrel (not in list), etc.

So each sentence needs a verb (from verbs list), adjective (from adjectives list), noun, noun.

Now the task is to create 200 sentences without repeating any words. That's a lot, but let's start building them one by one, ensuring that each word is used only once.

Let me start with the first few:

1. Assist random ship news
But "assist" is a verb, "random" adjective, "ship" noun, "news" noun. That works. Now remove these words from the lists.

Next sentence:
2. Cram average game reason

And so on. But I need to check that each word is only used once. Since this will take time, perhaps I can find a pattern or cycle through different verbs and adjectives.

But since I have to do 200 sentences, this manual process is error-prone. Maybe I can group the words into categories:

Verbs: assist, cram, driving, make, quarrel, prolong, turn, treat, educate, identify, specify, restrict, etc.

Adjectives: random, average, brown, tall, bloody, cooperative, cheap, partly, self, equal, wealthy, angry, joy, etc.

Nouns: ship, news, threshold, inspector, game, reason, sanction, giant, enemy, theme, post, car, bias, context, invite, arrow, guarantee, novel, impression, height, mask, place, package, interaction, snap, trading, refugee, bedroom, sigh, straw, desk, closer, loot, bowl, executive, steak, faith, button, country, wire, export, operation, mill, disclose, etc.

Each time, pick a verb, then an adjective that hasn't been used yet, followed by two nouns. Make sure all four words are unique and haven't been used in previous sentences.

I'll start creating the sentences step by step, cross-checking each word to ensure no repeats. This will take some time, but let's proceed systematically.
