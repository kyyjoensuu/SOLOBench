#21) When my body told me I needed a new career, it was an emotional rollercoaster for those of us living our daily lives. But today is another day and we are all going to the doctor together so that everyone gets their yearly check-up. 
#22) In 10 years the situation we had will become more severe in about six months time but thankfully it isn’t nearly as bad as before because I have been able to learn new coping mechanisms which have improved my quality of life by about +5% in recent months. 
#23) I can clearly see through the eyes of those closest to me that everything has changed and now it is easier to accept these changes, we know this time will come but at least my family are giving us emotional support along with guidance by trying our best to keep things together every day until then.
#24) It was incredible to receive your encouragement on all fronts when times are tough; I can't express how much it means to me that you understand and care about everything going on in our lives and try to help whenever possible because sometimes just knowing someone cares makes a big difference! 
#25) I feel grateful for having lived through this rough patch in my life because I have learned so many new things and can now handle any situation with more confidence than ever before.
