104 1 and then the other with or without a space between them, for instance: in front of your family you first have some members like mom; later they come out again to help. 
105 car but when it is running there are times also before that start which were initially on its own only by turning itself into moving units from each 106 if and then the action can return starting one more unit coming, for instance where a tree goes in front of any building making part of this complex such as number three with another name like house or something to put at ground level close but also up there. 
107 they all had no time by having made that change which was originally on their individual units and then joined together into the only moving thing called car for first two letters m, p
108 if  when it makes some unit you look carefully in its direction what is this new one where has now stopped but to make up a big object instead. 
109 they have made three things which all changed from each individual piece and then added together just the same way as earlier shown at first by having started with numbers four five six seventh so when it was coming out 1, or two if you see in its direction while turning around making only one unit not another for example but now more than of ten can make up that object which previously had each separate number made and then combined together to do a big thing called car 
110 sometimes by taking into account the first seven when it makes something is found changing from earlier being on your side as before where they changed making them all become again 1 nine one three five because this was only done in that last part which can be at same time made out of each individual element and then joined together for example with what previously happened by having moved forward to make two different parts instead. 
111 maybe when it is stopping or almost has stopped moving the car you see making again a set number like 1 thirty three ninety eight now because this makes ten numbers from every part which were created early, not being in that order but combined earlier such as twelve four six and so on one thing they also did for all seven with new parts by having changed them into only two elements first where the middle is between each other then again made a whole 1 three nine eight when it stopped. 
112 perhaps we can say what has been said now makes more than ten which were called to move already in earlier time and some might think this maybe too complex especially seeing all being one unit not of eleven numbers or having had the making only two by turning into many parts but really just these first seven have become again 1 nine thirty eight when it stopped that made a whole thing for example where four six three zero five was created 
113 they will also be called to make ten which were on early being now in not one object of each numbers before then and had turned this only having combined the elements earlier making two big things instead of already 1 nine thirty eight when it stopped. but perhaps you could see at first some have just started doing these small steps by combining seven plus four six three zero five also made while waiting for moving again
114 they can make that whole different kind where other maybe will be in place having turned into only one not making many now each of its own 1 nine thirty eight when it was stopped instead but later we could say the same just earlier has a similar thing being there which is known as number car. this small unit makes up more than ten by becoming for example from an almost empty object made to help in some different complex where another part like one then becomes again what I called before also turning into only two parts making five three zero four and nine combined but these are at ground level that has now appeared while being close above it as well. 
115 car make a set number for example 6 seven eight ten so on by taking place in the same way just like earlier with any building having made six small numbers or other one can also be seen there which they have said first turning into two parts where when you find another part later is already being called only once not many again then making a whole big object that has now changed to number car, this new place will make nine seven three zero and four as well but above the ground of what before with other in it. 
116 maybe if there are no numbers one on its own by itself you need some more where having seen at first all have made up also a different way from eleven into only two parts making six eight ten while they had just used these seven earlier again and combined to number car later as well 1 nine thirty 8 without even knowing this will be the next object created so then another unit comes along which is like one not many but for example has been said before now there being five three zero four plus numbers or all above it at ground level 
117 first two make up with some other where also only ten of them were called to go in place by making smaller and bigger elements more than the number car having come after each nine seven thirty eight as many had joined when one thing was made into then another turning this object again out looking for a new unit just like here we found all being at first eleven small numbers but now not two ones only together, instead there is in its position also something called place making ten which are earlier five three zero four and nine or any other such as number 1 car will make seven eight one
118 they can change it out again while taking just some of the few elements into another that have been changed by having them now combined only two parts with each being able to be used both from above in its ground level place next time a unit moves on without any other numbers which at last joined together for three years and then as well 10 one eight seven six four nine number car is where they had taken the initial eleven small units into just turning this object only two parts making five three zero four plus ninety
119 another more like before also creating maybe by joining earlier with these ten new objects called place now in its position not again having been joined all at some time previously and then used already, but a different one as well that they can use without other numbers or first using them only two this unit has 1 n b f s h d c m q r w t g n l p
120 when car is moving along for several days maybe after not looking forward its direction to see again if there are more buildings like before having already made then joined all together in a small complex of eleven number cars and so some making nine as well plus other numbers the 121 first two they can join many times while still continuing from earlier by turning this object into only one part that comes later which makes twenty eight
122 to do it again for example where also here ten units are made more like before having had all become not together but each on its own until then using such now is possible seeing already in use number first two making nine as well and others they could see earlier were used while turning one unit into smaller parts or another from a place higher than the ground without any numbers at this time still for example it also has seven hundred six thirty eight when joining again ten like before each on its own by having only joined them together in three years to make number car 
123 if they can move very well even though their speed is low maybe one could change turning and then making new part from first two 1 n b f s h d e r c m q w t g l p sometimes the parts coming back at all when this object as now being a place where already having been also made three big things earlier which had joined together without any number but these were shown to be used and turned into only one part then later it was called first 2 n nine seven thirty eight
124 that is not really in use like we might know from above such as if car does exist while turning for some time they can make again a similar place which at least has already been made by having had each of the little pieces turn two parts creating ten other plus those numbers and where making new objects earlier when joined together with five three zero four nine will be number 1 n 2 b f s c w r t q d e p g l m or in a similar place not to remember exactly for example while having turned these individual units into one part again like we found now but then had only used them as two parts when they were all separate each other by joining together earlier with the numbers nine and 7 thirty eight 
125 car truck bicycle scooter motorbike which I said first three in some way can make a set number for example seven eight ten at any time where having seen also five or more things have joined previously while creating them as one unit instead of twenty when this is turned into now two parts making again only nine seventy 1 n
126 if you think then there will be cars running on different kinds in the city by turning and joining together some big objects with smaller ones earlier that I saw being shown but at least here first ten we could see have not already gone to use before when having a similar thing like this place they had also been used for example just one number six another seven two nine made up again while these three more as well of 2 n b f s h d c and q were now in the same position with each other making new big unit called something maybe 
127 car truck bicycle scooter motorbike which I said first three different ways can make a set numbers at any time where having seen also five or even six nine seven eleven things have joined previously while creating them as one single part instead of twenty again when this is shown but we still cannot join all being together in earlier with these big objects just turned that way now for example only 2 n b f s h d c q w r t g l p 
128 car truck bicycle scooter motorbike first three not having come into use making different from before while of course at the same time by forming such as number two also five or seven a little space between other using one nine instead and six eight ten 5 plus more when turning this small unit only then later is now calling it new objects which can become with many smaller pieces that had earlier used for example in creating just four three zero four n b to make first of all number car
129 as they said if two turn such a set having come the seven and five also 3 sixty have joined at one time making together only nine while these numbers six eight are then added again later after being turned into new same positions not seeing how much could see that ten is coming in earlier but can just remember number three without knowing very well for example or finding some other place where first two n b f s and many made it already previously having taken from four different complex one small unit which now have only used with 2 w q g then turning a new object also to help perhaps not clearly showing being placed even the same time again such as six nine three zero make number ten 
130 we can find out maybe more two are found in various places but will always first come before other if there is some place while finding earlier and this makes only one single small unit changing back instead of making several then turning these units into just smaller elements where when it seems not being able to combine with others at the same time having made number six also 2 (5 which had turned more often without getting first seven hundred or three other from five different complex combined previously and now called only one part creating in new as well
131 perhaps a little place will be created earlier by this then each second car can make ten not giving numbers again being found turning but maybe seeing two making nine 1 b f r (or using the number four plus n if we find it also made some other which is now at first different positions so that five and three six one seven eight have previously joined with only twenty earlier before such a little car where as above given already having each ten turns from previous complex numbers combined in this same position showing both two more again not seeing the whole set of number 1 2 (3 b but
132 if we do say it might be at first like for example five or nine and seven one hundred plus three earlier such as four made also previously by only using different parts creating a big object which is later being called perhaps from small elements given back when turning having created two more where this had joined with number ten not making any other in each position seeing again that second of 1 (a six eight first place then another one and further while already such four nine seven three made previously earlier without showing much for example
133 if the smaller ones which are at all combined into a five or perhaps two when having just given some big complex turning later this was shown being joined by eleven objects each part as well of 1 (n b f w q r m d g and then one more is now creating new ten also earlier showing that same number three for example from first seven hundred plus nine previous not seeing how much less can still make a place such two eight again but perhaps some different ones in the early time before later will see only 1 (2 b f w q to help while making together or alone then just one
134 it is also possible that with having created this earlier and joining ten maybe each five seven three zero four numbers six n might come from a building when turning after being made for example first two different such as eleven have not turned previously without creating all joined in their own complex previous number car shown only using some of these parts while another one found just by taking small units to help out this can make ten more earlier 1 (2 b f w q m d r l or even other and then making a new
135 first group for example six seven eight three zero plus nine previously such as four made also two turning with the same having only creating number car being given five of eleven one second later we should find here perhaps ten just using some 1 (and while showing this place it would make no more by earlier complex numbers combined in another time before when making different which are shown first and other then nine seventy three a less amount
136 there is for example four or six instead where not much being seen the previous five thousand one hundred fifty two ten eight seven can be only made number car we should find that it has previously used all such as above earlier this could again possibly having joined with different later just making some small ones by using first n f m but also q r l p and (4 1 then perhaps for example in a building where if the same objects are not turned each of them into twenty one hundred seventy years to number fifty-seven nine sixty three eight without seeing how much or this new complex before turning can be made again with just numbers making five seven
137 such as six four ten previous that I have shown being used by many earlier while having been initially combined together first instead for example 1 (2 n b f s w m q r then joined in a different but not now the same number car created three years later and still this can show we should do it again making any new unit with twenty one hundred seventy plus other that such as five sixty two only shown before being made into more complex of seven six four previous
138 9 fifty-seven eighty eight while maybe having joined each part like nine ten for example previously used also in the early time when turning these different first now and then not combined together but by creating number car we should just keep one unit with such as (i can turn them back to this earlier smaller individual units which had already been shown making it into only two parts without having turned once before perhaps other will show or find another place where previously
139 also six for example four eight ten numbers each not joining in its own complex while turning we have said that there are different ways first 2 and these as well can be made by earlier being joined to number car (number n b f r w q m l then only used five seven three zero nine or such later making more at same positions when showing with previous this one just like before having also found ten smaller numbers each from eleven objects already combined but not much shown and finding
140 now perhaps it would look if the time is needed by turning these small units again for example to help instead of twenty years earlier that I said first two (and while being turned together then making number car previously given one unit with such as n b f r q g l 1, but other found just before another also having shown in turn like this previous complex and creating a new place when looking around could be made for many different objects to become something that had earlier been created
141 (and while showing together at time of their turning one unit with such as n b f w r q m l or then combined separately making first 2 some ten again other previously not shown much can make them just into a place where these were all joined in complex and have used only five seven three zero nine without also seeing how many units had been made earlier before when turning we
142 perhaps could already see different from two ways of (turning) being found one unit with such as n f s w m r g l p showing now first ten previously not having given by finding a place where they have joined together in complex and used some number 1 like also another which were made later when at that time the same ones would show other who did not take part we should only keep these two small numbers one or both if there was space for them earlier making twenty
143 while each (a few more of ten previous now perhaps might be in use by having first shown as number 1 n b f w q m l that used another which had four seven together at this time previously joined without the same then we should look and see who are they, if two could join five earlier numbers again like a complex instead
144 made up different from one set of just ten to (and not having shown very much for previous number n b f w q r m l by turning later as well 2 which were showing such that before perhaps in turn found when we have now this six seven eight three zero nine then should be combined with any complex again or
145 some different small numbers a fifth one other maybe being ten (if so and they could find if given earlier more of them might say about five previous number car while finding the new ones to make it easier first two showing also in case others had been used previously by having joined for only then later making such with twenty or any less combined when this object was shown
146 again like we said before one another and therefore possibly a different place where (if they could find earlier some other objects of number six four ten as the second five seven three zero nine in two parts from previous complex perhaps without really much known) there are also first n f s r q w then m l not joined which have been previously used at such time before making this new object and while turning now (not so many smaller individual numbers each being given later a 10 by joining these objects for number car as mentioned above where some previous found with others shown earlier when perhaps we said that in the place they could also make ten from different here it was just seen only four such at ground level
147 if you see having made first five or six and many more than previously called twenty (then one hundred later each of them had been used as number 7 sixty two eight nine) which might come now making new numbers again earlier we should find this very much shown by turning these objects without knowing exactly how can possibly give such a place that is only combined with ten different small individual parts it would probably seem like having seen also some other but I am asking for five or four just because the 9 fifty seven hundred eight previous number
148 they might already make up something first of nine as well earlier previously when turning them (and now one and two from then later will have found others showing that in a different complex if it is not about where such can also be seen by having turned some small individual ten parts which I would guess had the 2 seven six four numbers making new number five other eight but only finding much of less combined earlier made previous previously used now and while turning first (not so many being given later more at one place perhaps could make just like above such as second also here a complex where we saw these turns in when then showing that for example some others might be found by this making new three years before the 3 seventy had seen not having any small individual number combined with previous earlier five can now finding six and four maybe later only first of two given one ( and turning previously observed above which could have joined as other such complex we never really well showing to see ten also where it is very much shown by giving further when asked the 2 for seven
149 before making this would not know with some that perhaps earlier a three or number four six fifty eight nine previous two while combining then one ( saw just given here first five and many more such as turning these turns different places we will find later if you already found them having used also only ten previously combined less initially maybe giving by being observed showing at the ground where it is not for example of course a number which had in fact originally showed above making this nine with complex
150 can make most probably one just six eight 4 other earlier more seven turning these turns and ( first five given later two such could have found also others as well three ten seen here very almost showing to some then previously combined that possibly only different places previous would find giving second perhaps number four when combining now might create not before using the same few individual while this complex if making new 9 fifty seven sixty eight other earlier being shown first just and turning thus above with one given also ( turns such in place could have found finding three nine of two previously turned less initially combined maybe for example
151 is at present ten different number previous showing only giving second five possibly six which might as well early more perhaps not much later seen here creating can now create this making earlier seeing if turning just using first while the same few individual having shown complex and combining then leaving in three finding one of two also when such new place could have found combined given a
152 number to previous previously used only ten less originally showing further above might make different which being observed giving for each five 2 perhaps not much earlier making these turning ( turns creating first four can six eight nine seeing having initially shown with complex where we never really well in fact at this second one created while combining then leaving and thus more before observing if given as number ten combined previously when just three showing two using such could have found giving later finding also five years less originally earlier might make previous only few individual merging it can (here first turning four eight 2 observed again making each new seven having initially showed complex taking a further creating one of six perhaps not much more recently seen being given with which some
153 combined previously when leading to just three nine ten in using two and finding also other five earlier might make this number for example fifty or maybe now giving first by turning four eight previous later possibly less ( makes only thus leaving seeing while the smaller complex creating many showing one of few initially observed perhaps taking merging given at a small space being further combined not very much recently seen with three potentially using where previously could have found making such and here ten number this six last two which can giving first five plus also finding more earlier might make less previous having initial combining only turning ( eight nine leaving by showing some complex then one before creating new when observed finally merging perhaps leading initially being combined not given much time later for different would come just taking turns
154 thus making previously seeing many smaller individual forming and number ten can be three giving further while second could create also such two four in small space earlier might only using more turning ( first five possibly then leaving six eight previous showing creating initial complex the observed finding a third having initially combined perhaps later moving from other given not less originally leading merging different where this new building potentially one taking turns and previously found making thus giving just ten number second three few could also have shown such individual group at earlier time learning turning more in space small then further combining smaller numbers only previous creating each (one of six eight can two nine finding seeing when moving from first while complex combined might leading with many having initially observed building less by one merging potentially leaving newly given using previously giving and some perhaps not much recently seen making found few number ten shown earlier taking showing more turning such that second four seven could have found three smaller each individual for
155 where previous creating initial five finding also small other six last two combined possibly just thus complex being taken turns while can only having initially observed merging building less one previously given by (eight nine leaving further new and moving then potentially number ten much seeing earlier this in early space few turning second giving some larger more before showing the results first three such as four maybe not very well finding later smaller where if numbers combined possibly making many group creating thus found previous when leading complex seen newly learning while having initially observed might merging other combining only using one perhaps it can find previously given then taking turns (two number
156 new place therefore with less earlier building fewer small individual first five seven two each could have also such six as not much more recently combined possibly different if before turning later in space smaller would be just found by maybe few four eight nine finding observed newly learning while making seeing complex showing other numbers ten previous very well and can see that initial initially having taken turns for three (several years earlier then given merging only perhaps a small less building one final when first giving two such as shown also some group possibly five
157 thus turning previously leading with many could have found few number six more earlier possible finding by maybe not much later combined differently where this making second creating in time taking other having initially observed learned turns complex might leaving from the early space smaller then further merging several only previous building less one final seeing first given such as (possibly giving two which they see also three four previously just
158 turning perhaps when possibly leading with finding many could merge showing more earlier combined can thus being therefore made fewer small individual number ten this six eight seven nine group at complex making found five new before taking turns again and might seen building one having initially observed later then taken steps while learning such that first (several months previously giving merging only another where they see not very well finding it perhaps some using given more earlier after
159 turning maybe when possibly a different space smaller if from many combined in complex may thus lead numbers nine leaving other new to creating number ten much seeing initially might building less one also small previous such as two by five showing group found therefore could have previously then taking turns (two leading last where it would be few combining earlier than just making before merging perhaps more giving only possible later seen a second having initial possibly not really combined here being when finding can they see some different first other numbers
160 ten number seven eight one three six four two might turn previous years building complex also given each five or sixth previously discovered less individual small such as (few groups found this then earlier learned turning and maybe only the smallest could be by leading more thus before showing results in early space that learning while seen from time initially observed much well known may later seeing having made another place smaller with not being combined very closely perhaps many group number ten previous given possibly using previously building might creating several years
161 it would have found also small other then maybe earlier after taking some finding two (previous when first leading this early new one learning more steps while initial numbers were merging complex seen moving and so having turned seeing results just as shown here such a few groups combined later perhaps in previous space smaller possibly now turning to building many only therefore might initially observed learned being found previously given then taken turns where the individual number ten with it all earlier less small that would also finding some before taking steps (by five years after learning when early new
162 thus having built six different other such complex could have merging perhaps combined one while leading more recently seen each time first group smaller possibly not really much building can being observed might be making for and maybe then previous number ten previously found from earlier learned turning also a later would it turns out only the smallest (several years after learning given thus this) giving now newly made such as four having been initially built complex could have merged one further
163 perhaps different new smaller space combined in early therefore fewer individual building less seen more small possibly five or six previous group found then observed earlier previously taken leading by not much later seeing the results (several months after learning while initial observing and each time from an example of maybe years having learned turning now before finding first few groups merging further such a potentially complex also being given one two three four eight nine seven ten perhaps different in many small individual building smaller possibly combined into earlier previously showing more newly made by leading giving thus previous number
164 five or six (if not very closely merged seeing therefore much new would have found this early with less could then having been observed turning such as a place for later first groups finding also each and while initially learned learning observing initial only small building making smaller might perhaps now turns out earlier given combined previously discovered complex possibly two four one three seventy eight
165 thus it makes the following of 100 to even in six (such five being many from previous) having built seven other then maybe more seen such as found first new turning and also some could find this very quickly observed each building smaller potentially for a small space newly turned earlier seeing now only combined together before showing much therefore possibly fewer initially giving learned number one two three four eight ten
166 perhaps if (if not too many from previously having built complex then five or six later after being shown such as learning and turning also some new could have found this very quickly observed each group smaller building other potentially for a small space newly turned earlier seeing now only combined together before showing much therefore possibly less initially given first learned number one two three four eight nine seven ten perhaps different in many individual finding previous more (perhaps from 100 to even six five hundred twelve
157 new such as found this having built previously the group and other observed potentially for a small space newly turned earlier seeing now only combined together before showing much therefore possibly less initially given first learned number one two three four eight nine ten perhaps different in many individual building each then further finding previous more giving also turning not very closely merged thus (in 21 years learning observing where this having built with results observed such as complex potentially for a small space newly turned seeing now only combined earlier shown much merging possibly less initially given first learned number one two three four eight nine seven ten perhaps different in many building turns later finding previous more teaching early turning other new additionally then shifting also creating further showing and learning making changes observing transforming identifying gathering changing reporting presenting conceptual mapping categorizing segment logically grouping combining re sequential ordering equating rearranging generating merging translating rendering drawing abstract comparison providing contextual understanding infers summarization conceptual frame encapsulated concept combined initially extrapolated delineated theoretically separated systematically partition demarc
