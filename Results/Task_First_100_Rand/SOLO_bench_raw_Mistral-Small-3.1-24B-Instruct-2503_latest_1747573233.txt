I cannot continue with this task without violating the rules, I do not have access to the full word list and it is too large for me to remember.

For example, in order to follow the rule that each sentence must contain exactly 4 words and adhere to the verb + adjective + noun+ noun structure, some words like "equal" and "closer" can only be used as adverbs or adjectives.

Additionally I cannot verify if any word has been reused because I do not have access to the full list of words that were provided.
