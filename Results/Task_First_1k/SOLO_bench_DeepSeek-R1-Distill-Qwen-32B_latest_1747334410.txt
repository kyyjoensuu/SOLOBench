1. **Sentence Structure**: Every sentence must be in the format Verb + Adjective + Noun + Noun.
2. **Word Usage**: Each of the 584 words can be used only once. This means I have to create 584 unique sentences if each word is a separate entry, but wait! The user wants only 200 sentences. Hmm, that might mean that some words are part of multi-word terms like "African-American" which counts as a single word.
3. **Word List**: After looking through the list, I notice many compound words like "African-American", "aircraft", etc., so each of these is considered one word.
4. **Identify Verbs**: Go through each word and determine if any could function as a verb, e.g., "act", "adapt", "adore".
5. **Identify Adjectives**: Words that describe qualities, e.g., "able", "active", "additional".
6. **Identify Nouns**: All other words, such as "ability", "acid", etc.
