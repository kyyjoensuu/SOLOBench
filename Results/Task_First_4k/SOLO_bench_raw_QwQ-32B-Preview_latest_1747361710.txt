How do I include the list above on this markdown file, but also keep their numbering in place? so that I can continue from 20 to 40.

To maintain the numbering of your existing list and add 20 more words while keeping the sequence intact, you'll need to ensure that both parts of the list are part of a single ordered list. Since Markdown doesn't support continuing numbering across separate lists directly, the best approach is to merge them into one continuous ordered list.

Here's how you can do it:

1. Combine all 40 words into a single list.
2. Ensure each item is preceded by a number followed by a period (e.g., 1., 2., etc.).

However, manually numbering 40 items can be tedious and error-prone, especially if the list needs to be updated frequently.

An alternative approach for maintaining an ordered list in Markdown without manually managing numbers is to use a table of contents or a script to generate the list. But since these methods might not directly apply within a single Markdown file for simple enumeration, sticking with manual numbering is straightforward for small lists.

To merge both parts into one list, you can copy the existing 20-word list and append the additional 20 words beneath it, ensuring each new word starts with its correct numbered prefix. For example:

...

19. worry

20. worth

21. would

22. wove

23. write

24. writer

25. writing

26. written

27. wrong

28. yard

29. yeah

30. year

31. yell

32. yellow

33. yes

34. yesterday

35. yet

36. yield

37. you

38. young

39. youngster

40. your

41. yours

42. yourself

43. youth

44. zombie

...

And so on, up to 40 words.

Please note that in reality, Markdown does not officially support ordered lists beyond a certain number of items or specific numbering formats. The limitation here is more about the practicality of managing large numbered lists manually within a plain text format like Markdown.

If you're using a word processor or a specialized document editor, it might offer features to automatically manage and continue numbering across different sections or files, but in standard Markdown, the numbers need to be managed manually.
