The extract provided seems to contain a large list of words and terms, many of which are quite common in everyday English usage. However, there is no specific context or detailed information provided about the content of these words. To create mathematical questions based on this extract, we could consider areas such as word frequency, etymology, or pattern recognition, but since we cannot access actual data, let's focus on creating a set of questions that involve basic concepts from combinatorics and probability theory.

### Questions and Detailed Answers

#### 1. How many unique words are listed in the provided extract?
**Answer:**
To determine the number of unique words, we need to count the distinct entries. The list appears to be quite extensive, with a significant portion repeated or used in double-underscores (e.g., `-0.65%`, `+1 Â· 70,000`). However, for simplicity, let's assume each word is unique without overlap.

The exact number of unique words can be determined by removing duplicates but given the format, we can count them based on distinct entries:
- Some duplicates include `words`, which are repeated multiple times because they appear at the beginning of many subcategories.
- Count each distinct entry independently.

For this extract, a full manual count would reveal that there are approximately 500 unique words listed. However, due to repetition within subsections and potential misspellings, the actual number could be higher.

#### 2. If we wanted to randomly select three common English words from these entries, what is the probability of selecting each word at least once in a single selection without replacement?
**Answer:**
Let's denote the total number of unique words listed as \( N \). We need to be mindful that some words are repeated, but we will ignore those for this calculation.

1. Probability of selecting a specific word first:
\[ P(\text{First Word}) = \frac{N}{500} \]

2. After removing the chosen word, the remaining number of unique words to select is \( N-1 \):
\[ P(\text{Second Word}) = \frac{N-1}{499} \]

3. After removing both the chosen and the second word, the remaining number of unique words:
\[ P(\text{Third Word}) = \frac{(N-2)}{498} \]

To find the probability of this sequence occurring at least once:
\[ P(\text{At Least One Success}) = 1 - (P(\text{First Word}) + P(\text{Second Word}) + P(\text{Third Word})) \]

For the sake of an example, let's assume \( N = 505 \) (a rough estimate based on the pattern):
- First Word:
\[ P(\text{First Word}) = \frac{505}{500} \approx 1.01 \]
- Second Word:
\[ P(\text{Second Word}) = \frac{(494)}{(495)} \approx 0.9987 \]
- Third Word:
\[ P(\text{Third Word}) = \frac{(493)}{(496)} \approx 0.9992 \]

\[ P(\text{At Least One Success}) = 1 - (1.01 + 0.9987 + 0.9992) \approx 1 - 3.0169 \approx 0 \]

So, the probability of selecting each word at least once is less than 100%. This is because these calculations assume that the first selection does not affect the probabilities in subsequent selections, which is not realistic given the nature of combinations and probabilities. In practice, this calculation would be based on a much larger sample size to ensure no two words are selected more than once.

#### 3. If we were to create a word cloud for the list of words, how many unique letters would appear on average if we took one word at random?
**Answer:**
For this question, we need to consider the most frequent first letter of each word provided in the list. For example:
- Words with `a` at the beginning include: Apple, Artific... etc.
- Words with `b` at the beginning include: Bee... etc.

Given that many common words have unique letters early in their alphabet, it is safe to assume that if we took a random word from this list and represented it in an algorithm, we would find that there are typically 16 distinct letters in such terms. This might not be precise but can give us an initial estimate of the average, which could range widely depending on specific distribution within the list at hand.

To provide a general answer:
- We have over 500 words and 26 unique letters (from A to Z). If we take one word at random and assume a uniform selection across all terms, the number of times a particular letter appears will be approximately equal to the number of unique letters in that specific word.

For the sake of simplification, if we take an average across all English common words:
\[ \text{Average Letter Frequency} = \frac{(16 \times 500 + 26)}{\text{Number of Unique Words}} \]

A more accurate approach would require knowing the frequency distribution of each letter in English terms.

#### 4. What is the expected number of times you will draw a word that starts with a vowel if we select one word at random from the list?
**Answer:**
To estimate the expected number of times a word starting with a vowel appears, we first count the total number of words starting with vowels (e.g., Words starting with 'v' include: Vegetable).

Then, we determine the ratio of these vowels to the overall number of words. Assuming the list is well-represented and using the English language rules for word length distribution, a rough estimate would be that around 40% to 60% of English terms begin with a vowel. Let's assume 50 words starting with a vowel for this estimation:

\[ \text{Total Words} = N \]

- Expected number of words starting with a vowel:
\[ E(\text{Vowel Start}) = 0.5N \]

This is a high estimate as it assumes all terms contain at least one vowel, which could vary significantly. A closer approximation would require knowing the exact distribution of vowel and consonant usage in the list.

#### Conclusion:
The questions above explore combinatorial concepts, probability theory, and basic statistical analysis related to the provided extract. The answers are based on hypothetical calculations assuming specific conditions for each question.
