It is common to hear phrases like "don't judge a book by its cover", which implies that outward appearances can be deceptive and we should not base our opinions solely on what we see on the surface. However, this saying does not hold water.

From an evolutionary perspective, making quick judgments based on appearances has been beneficial for human survival. Spotting potential threats based on visual cues was a matter of life or death for our ancestors. This instinctive reaction is still hard-wired in us today.

Also, numerous studies have shown that people often accurately deduce others' traits just by looking at their photos . For example, facial features are correlated with aggressiveness and dominance.

But we shouldn't completely disregard the saying either. We've all met seemingly nice people who turned out to be awful underneath it all. There can certainly exceptions where outward looks mislead us about someone's true character .

The key is to not stop at first impressions but rather use observations as a starting point that should be tested and confirmed through real interactions with others before drawing solid conclusions.

So, while we shouldn't dismiss appearances entirely, we should also avoid jumping to final judgments based only on what we see initially. Take the saying to heart but understand it has limits and use your full critical thinking skills too.
