The extract provided is a list of words and phrases related to food and agriculture, including various agricultural terms and activities. Below are several math-related questions based on the content you've given:

### Question 1: Counting and Summing Up Words
**Q:** How many unique words starting with "A" are listed in the extract?
**A:** There are 20 unique words starting with "A" that are listed in the extract. They include various terms such as "apple," "agriactivism," "agriculture," etc. This total gives you a total of:
\[ \text{Unique Words} = 3, \text{8-point system}, \text{715-point score}, \ldots, \text{apple} \]

### Question 2: Ratio of Terms Including and Excluding "Agriculture"
**Q:** What is the ratio of terms that include agriculture (e.g., "agriculture," "agricultural," "agriculture industry") to those that do not?
**A:** To find this, we need to count all the relevant terms:
\[ \text{Words with Agriculture} = \{agriculture, agricultural, agriactivism, agri-environmentality, agrochemicals, agropalms, agromodels, agriculture industry, agriculture production, etc.\} \]
And:
\[ \text{Non-Agriculture Terms} = \{apple, apple-core, apple juice, apricot, apple oil,$etc.\} \]
The ratio is then calculated as:
\[ \text{Ratio} = \frac{\text{# Of Agricultural Related Terms}}{\text{# Of Non-Agricultural Related Terms}} = \frac{28}{62} = \frac{14}{31} \]

### Question 3: Frequency of Certain Words
**Q:** How many times are the words "agriculture industry" and "agricultural" used separately?
**A:** To find these frequencies, we need to count each occurrence in the list. For example, "agriculture industry" appears 10 times and "agriactivism" appears 6 times. However, considering that terms with identical strings of letters may be counted multiple times:
\[ \text{"agriculture industry": Counts} = 3 \]
\[ \text{agriactivism:" Counts} = 2 \]
\[ \text{"agricultural": Counts} = 3 \]
\[ \text{"agriculture": Counts} = 4 \]
\[ \text{"agrochemicals": Counts} = 1 \]
\[ \text{etc.} \]

### Question 4: Mathematical Modeling of Word Frequency in the List
**Q:** Develop a simple mathematical model to estimate the number of times each word will appear after deleting all instances of "agriculture."
**A:** A simple linear regression approach can be used. Let's assume that removing "agriculture" from the list does not remove any words:
\[ Y(i) = a \cdot f(x_i) + b \]
Where:
- \(Y(i)\) is the number of times word \(x_i\) will appear.
- \(f(x_i)\) is the fraction of words in the original list that start with \(x_i\).
- \(b\) is a constant that accounts for the initial frequency of all other words before the removal. Here, since we're removing an entire section (agriculture), \(a\) can be set to be very close to zero to reflect negligible impact.
\[ b = Y_{total} \cdot d_{population_of_nonagricultural} \]

Here is a possible approximation:
- Removing agriculture leaves us with:
  - Words starting with A-Z, excluding agriculture: 50128 unique words starting with these letters.
- All other unique words start with non-A letters. For simplicity and assuming each non-agriculture word appears equally often as the others:
\[ Y_{nonagricultural_initial} \approx \frac{1}{50128} \] (Assuming equal frequency for all non-agriculture starting words)
Thus, a rough model would look like:
\[ Y = p \cdot f(x) + c \]
But since the original list contains many non-agriculture terms and we're removing a large portion around the beginning of the alphabet:
\[ b \approx 0.095472 * \frac{1+x}{5008} \cdot y^c \]
Where \(x\) is the count variable for each word in our simplified model, and \(y^c\) represents the probability that a randomly selected word starts with any of these letters. We then estimate the number of words before "agriculture" by considering all terms starting with A-Z:
\[ Y_{total} = (50116) \cdot (0.095472) \]
where we are calculating without taking into account the fact that many words start with other letters as well, which complicates the calculation significantly to handle such a large set of terms.

### Additional Question: Probability of Choosing a Word Based on Frequency and Inclusion
**Q:** What is the probability that randomly selecting a word from this list will be included solely within agricultural-related terms if we exclude all words starting with 'A'?
**A:** To solve this, we know how many words in total begin with A and then calculate the relative frequency of these terms by dividing each term's count by the total set. This is approximately:
\[ F_{agricultural} = \frac{28}{10357} ≈ 0.0026496 \]
And considering we exclude all words starting with A:
\[ P(select ~not~A) ≈ 1 − 0.0026496 ≈ 0.9973504 \]
This means there is approximately a 99.7% chance of selecting an agricultural-related term when we exclude all terms starting with 'A'. However, since we also consider terms that are not just "agriculture," this scenario becomes far more complex to model accurately and may require additional statistical data. If further analysis is desired based on the probability \(P(select~not~A)\), an actual model or simulation could represent the likelihood of selecting one of these terms given our exclusion criteria, which can involve understanding of combinatorial mathematics and probability theory in dealing with lists of word frequency counts. For demonstration purposes:
\[ P(\text{not A} | \text{Agriculture}) ≈ 0.9973504 \]

These questions and answers provide a mathematical perspective on the distribution, counting, and modeling of words related to food and agriculture based on the extract you provided. Note that some of these calculations are quite simplified and may differ significantly if specific patterns or distributions within the list require more sophisticated statistical analysis.
