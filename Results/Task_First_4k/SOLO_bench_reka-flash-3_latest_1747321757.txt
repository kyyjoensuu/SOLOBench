1. **Identify Verb Tenses**: The sentence uses past perfect ("had ate") and simple present ("drink"). We need to correct these to their proper forms.
2. **Check Past Participle Form**: After the auxiliary verb "had", the main verb should be in its past participle form. In this case, "ate" should be corrected to "eaten".
3. **Correct Simple Present Tense**: The verb "drink" in the second part of the sentence is incorrect because it follows "and" which implies conjunction with another action. Here, "have drunk" would be more appropriate to maintain tense consistency.
4. **Dictionary of Verbs**: We start by defining a dictionary `verbs` that maps base verbs to their simple past and past participle forms.
5. **Split Sentence**: The input sentence is split into individual words for easier manipulation.
6. **Correct Past Perfect Tense**: We check each word to see if it follows "had". If it does, we replace the simple past form ("ate") with the correct past participle ("eaten").
7. **Correct Conjunction Verb**: After fixing the first part of the sentence, we use string replacement to correct "drink" to "have drunk" in the second part of the conjunction to maintain tense consistency.
8. **Output the Corrected Sentence**: Finally, the corrected words are joined back into a single string and printed.
