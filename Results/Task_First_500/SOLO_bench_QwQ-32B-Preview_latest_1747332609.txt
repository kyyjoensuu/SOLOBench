1. **Separate the Word List into Parts of Speech:** Identify verbs, adjectives, and nouns from the list. Some words may serve multiple roles, so context is key.
2. **Create Combinations:** For each sentence, pick one verb, one adjective, and two nouns in that order, ensuring no word repeats across sentences.
3. **Ensure Sentence Structure:** Construct sentences following Verb + Adjective + Noun + Noun structure.
4. **Check for Coherence:** While not strictly required by the rules, attempting to make sentences meaningful can help ensure proper usage of words.
