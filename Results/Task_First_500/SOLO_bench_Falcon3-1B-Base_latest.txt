1. Convert every sentence to its corresponding function. For instance, the sentence "the dog chased its tail" will become a function f(x) = x - the dog chases its tail."
2. Use each word in exactly one phrase as specified by a function application, where the meaning of that part needs to be defined. For example, use the phrase "the thing" as a function applied to another sentence f(x) = sentence containing "thing": f(the thing) could mean "noun denoting an object or idea."
3. Ensure that no word in the original sentences can have multiple meanings when translated to functions. Instead, each mathematical expression must represent a unique interpretation based on the context of each phrase used in the original sentence.
4. For example, take our first sentence: **The dog chased its tail**. To turn this into a function, we would define a mapping f(z) = 'chase', where z is any word from the given list ("dog", "chased", "tail"). The mapping f(object noun of phrase or action verb in sentence, such as "thing") needs to be defined separately for each distinct instance.
5. f(dog) = 'chased' - The operation is ‘chased’ here as given by the provided word set. This implies using only the phrase "chase" as described in the instructions, and this translates directly to a mathematical function where you apply the operation corresponding to the input element into a list of words.
6. f(the thing x) = noun denoting an object or idea (with the additional requirement that when used as f(subject) it must match the noun from whatever source is associated with the phrase and not necessarily the noun's specific form but its general nature.) This function creates variables where you apply whatever operation you assign to a letter x, which could be anything from an operator such as addition (+), multiplication (*), or subtraction (−) by a number, to some arbitrary word in the provided list. For example, if f() means the noun noun denotes something (which can only be assigned nouns from the provided list), then with x denoting any letter of the alphabet you could get: f('book') = noun indicating something called a book as an object.
7. f(the thing x y) = verb denoting action or state-activeness (again assuming that only nouns from the word list are used, so f(thing) can't be directly assigned due to the complexity with the concept of the whole sentence). The input letter x can represent any of our words from the dictionary, and y represents any other letter in the same set. A real-world example could be: f('chase') = 'chased' acting as a verb which denotes that something action is in progress.
8. The final stage after constructing these expressions is to form mathematical sentences by arranging these functions in logical order and performing all the intended operations as stated – for example, using multiple instances of our constructed function applications could give us complex functions like f(f(x)), where f(x) is one of the possible outputs from the previously written functions. However, since every sentence has to be translated into a unique mathematical expression independently and this conversion should ideally adhere to specific rules as defined in step 2, I will only consider simple direct applications here.
