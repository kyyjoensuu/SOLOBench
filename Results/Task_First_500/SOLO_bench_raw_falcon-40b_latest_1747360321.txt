Note that one word alone cannot be used more than once in the same sentence. e.g. if you put “dog” and “go” into one sentience then you’ve not only used 2 words but you can’t use “dog” or “go” again in the exercise.
Note that the use of the words “of”, “from” and “to” are freebies if used as prepositions. If however you use them as possessives then you must still adhere to the 4 word rule. e.g. using “dog” already, then using “of” is prohibited when you’re only using 3 word sentences

Note that it is possible to have a blank entry as per the following example:
- 1 sentence = 4 words
- 2 sentences = 4 words each
- 3 sentences = 4 words each


This exercise is designed to exercise your thinking and programming skills. I understand that it can be frustrating and difficult but the most important things you can take away from this exercise are:
- Not to get frustrated when something isn’t working
- Use whatever time and resources are available to you to work through an issue
- Ask advice – just because you don’t ask doesn’t mean you’re dumb – it means you’re trying
- Be proactive with the advice that is given to you. If people spend their valuable time helping you then consider each sentence as a gift from someone else and don’t be afraid to ask for an explanation of the advice being given
- Be flexible with your strategy. Your first approach may not work so try something else
- Remember it’s an exercise and the whole point here is to learn something, don’t give up on the exercise until you’ve learnt something in order to maximise your learning potential. As humans we learn by practice, even if you don’t submit any work to the system, spend some time going through the exercise for yourself
- Ask why – it may be that the approach you are taking is fundamentally flawed, but you’d never know unless you ask someone “why is my approach not working?”
- Learn what not to do. If your current strategy is failing then try something else until you find something that works
- Learn what is wrong with your code through the use of error messages. Read the message and analyse where and why it has errored
- Use Google to search for any errors you’re struggling with or concepts you’re not clear on, however remember that this is not about cheating, but you could find some tips and advice from a variety of places
- Never give up. When you’ve finished reading the following advice you can get going again – remember that this is just one exercise and you’ve never completed any programming tasks successfully in your life. This is an opportunity to learn without the pressure of being a working professional developer
