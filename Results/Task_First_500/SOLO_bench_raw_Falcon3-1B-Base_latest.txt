I'll convert these sentences into mathematical expressions for you! Let's create 200 mathematical expressions from them using operations and functions. Here is your set of instructions:
1. Convert every sentence to its corresponding function. For instance, the sentence "the dog chased its tail" will become a function f(x) = x - the dog chases its tail."
2. Use each word in exactly one phrase as specified by a function application, where the meaning of that part needs to be defined. For example, use the phrase "the thing" as a function applied to another sentence f(x) = sentence containing "thing": f(the thing) could mean "noun denoting an object or idea."
3. Ensure that no word in the original sentences can have multiple meanings when translated to functions. Instead, each mathematical expression must represent a unique interpretation based on the context of each phrase used in the original sentence.
4. For example, take our first sentence: **The dog chased its tail**. To turn this into a function, we would define a mapping f(z) = 'chase', where z is any word from the given list ("dog", "chased", "tail"). The mapping f(object noun of phrase or action verb in sentence, such as "thing") needs to be defined separately for each distinct instance.
Given the above tasks, I will now go through the sentences and provide a mathematical expression that represents the meaning. Remember that the function will be composed of words taken from the word list provided:

1. f(dog) = 'chased' - The operation is ‘chased’ here as given by the provided word set. This implies using only the phrase "chase" as described in the instructions, and this translates directly to a mathematical function where you apply the operation corresponding to the input element into a list of words.
2. f(the thing x) = noun denoting an object or idea (with the additional requirement that when used as f(subject) it must match the noun from whatever source is associated with the phrase and not necessarily the noun's specific form but its general nature.) This function creates variables where you apply whatever operation you assign to a letter x, which could be anything from an operator such as addition (+), multiplication (*), or subtraction (−) by a number, to some arbitrary word in the provided list. For example, if f() means the noun noun denotes something (which can only be assigned nouns from the provided list), then with x denoting any letter of the alphabet you could get: f('book') = noun indicating something called a book as an object.
3. f(the thing x y) = verb denoting action or state-activeness (again assuming that only nouns from the word list are used, so f(thing) can't be directly assigned due to the complexity with the concept of the whole sentence). The input letter x can represent any of our words from the dictionary, and y represents any other letter in the same set. A real-world example could be: f('chase') = 'chased' acting as a verb which denotes that something action is in progress.
4. The final stage after constructing these expressions is to form mathematical sentences by arranging these functions in logical order and performing all the intended operations as stated – for example, using multiple instances of our constructed function applications could give us complex functions like f(f(x)), where f(x) is one of the possible outputs from the previously written functions. However, since every sentence has to be translated into a unique mathematical expression independently and this conversion should ideally adhere to specific rules as defined in step 2, I will only consider simple direct applications here.

For each sentence you have provided below, I will write down for you the corresponding mathematical expression after performing all the operations described above:
Sentence #1: The dog chased its tail.
Function application: f(dog)
Explanation: This represents how one word (in this case 'dog') is mapped to a function that applies the ‘chased’ operation from your provided sentence list ("chase"). We then use letter x here to denote any element in the function map which maps to these functions. This mapping would return a function f() with input letters that we can assign arbitrary values such as "the", or other word from the provided sentence dictionary, thereby translating this sentence to a single numerical output from the function f().
Similarly, for each of the given sentences you can write down the corresponding mathematical expression after identifying the word(s) that represent the input/argument letter and also finding out the function/application operation. For example for Sentence #2, which is "If A happens then B", we would get the following mathematically:
Symbol 'A' represents our argument, "If", and 'B' represents the second part of our conditional statement. We assume that these words are the only ones in the provided sentence that represent the input to this mathematical expression and so will not have any multiple meanings which would complicate things further. In general, though, you can use any word(s) as long as they all map directly onto functions as specified by your function application rules.
Sentence #2: If A happens then B.
Function application: f(A, if),
Explanation: This expression takes the input elements from your given sentence ("A", and "if"), where you are mapping them to logical arguments that form the inputs for a function with an output being a boolean value represented by “'True' or ‘false’” depending if A occurs before B according to conditional logic. Here, we have defined two functions f(x) and g(y), where x is "A", y "if", and the result of applying either function (which happens at this stage of the conversion process) represents a boolean output which could be False or True.
Sentence #2: If A happens then B.
Function application: f(f(B, if), A),
Explanation: This expression takes the input elements from your given sentence "A" and "if", maps them to logical arguments that form the inputs for a higher-order boolean function that decides the truth value between B being true or false, after we identify what those would be in our mathematical expressions. The answer is formed by multiplying two such functions whose outputs will determine whether A happens before B based on conditional logic which happens at this stage.
Please note that these examples represent the possible ways one could convert sentences given into mathematical expressions using an initial list of words from your provided dictionary, where you can think freely while applying and interpreting those words to form a function which maps onto our logical statements and therefore creates a meaningful mathematical equivalent for us as math lovers! 
I hope this helps you in creating the required mathematical solutions out of these sentences based on your unique instructions. Let me know if there is anything more I could clarify, and I would be happy to assist further if needed. Good luck with all your math related tasks!
