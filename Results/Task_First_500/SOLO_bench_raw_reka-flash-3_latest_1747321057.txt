Alright, let's begin generating the sentences. Starting with the first one. I need to use a verb from the word list but only once. The structure is Verb + Adjective + Noun + Noun. Let me pick "Bible" as one of the nouns later. For example: "Assemble Bible account anthropology." Wait, does that fit? Assemble is the verb, Bible is noun1, account (adjective?), no—account is a noun. Wait, adjectives must modify nouns. Maybe "Adjoin academic application biology"? Adjoin is a verb, academic is adjective, application and biology are nouns. Hmm, not sure. Let me check the word list again.

Wait, "academic" and "application" are in the list. So "Adhere academic assistant anthropology." Adhere (verb), academic (adjective), assistant (noun?), no—assistant is a noun. Wait, structure must be Verb + Adj + Noun + Noun. So maybe "Address accident atomic agriculture." Address verb, accident adjective? No, accident is a noun. Hmm.

Let's try again. Verb: "Adjustment" is a noun in the list. Maybe start with a different verb. "Actively adjust academic airline." Actively (adverb), adjust is verb. Not matching structure. Need Verb + Adj + Noun + Noun. Let me look for verbs that can pair with adjectives and nouns.

Take "Advise" as a verb. Then an adjective: "Aggressive advice agency agriculture." No—aggressive is not in the list. Wait, word list has "adjective": let's check. Words like "academic", "annual", "awful", "barely", "basically", "bold", "brave", "clearly", "closer", "competitive", "consistent", "cool", "crucial", "crazy", etc. Wait, from the list:

Possible adjectives: academic, awful, brave, clear, closer, competitive, consistent, crucial, crazy, essential, exciting, extreme, familiar, fearless, fashionable, fierce, fitting, flexible, formal, frequent, friendly, grateful, great, gentle, giant, good, happy, healthy, heavy, high, huge, ideal, impressive, important, interested, interesting, intelligent, intense, intrinsic, large, late, legal, legitimate, little, local, logical, major, massive, modern, necessary, neutral, new, normal, notable, numerous, old, opposite, original, overall, particular, physical, possible, practical, precise, proper, public, pure, rapid, real, recent, regular, responsible, rough, serious, sharp, short, significant, silly, simple, smart, solid, special, stable, strict, successful, sufficient, tall, thin, total, traditional, tough, unique, usual,valid, various, vast, violent, visible, vocal, white, wide, wise, working, young.

Wait, but from the given word list, adjectives are words that have to be exactly as listed. For example, "academic" is an adjective (noun form also exists). So possible verbs: assemble, assist, assure, attack, etc.

Let's try a verb like "Assemble". Then need an adjective followed by two nouns. So "Assemble annual application analysis." Annual is adjective, application and analysis are nouns. That works. Sentence 1: Assemble annual application analysis. Now mark those words as used.

Next sentence: Verb could be "Assist". Adjective: "academic"? "Assist academic agency agricultural." Agricultural is adjective (yes, from the list). So "Assist academic agency agricultural." But wait, "agricultural" is an adjective modifying "agency"? The structure would be Verb + Adj + Noun + Noun. Wait, "agency" is a noun here. So Assist (verb) + academic (adj) + agency (noun) + agricultural (adj)? No, that doesn't fit. Because the last two words need to be nouns. Adjective can only come after the verb and before the first noun.

Wait, correct structure: Verb + Adjective + Noun + Noun. So for example, "Assist academic agency agriculture." But here, "agency" is a noun, so adjective should modify "agriculture". Wait, but the sentence would be "Assist academic agency agriculture." That doesn't make sense. Maybe "Assist academic agent agricultural." Agent is a noun, agricultural is adjective modifying it. So "Assist academic agent agricultural." Yes, that works. But "agent" isn't in the word list. Let me check the word list again.

Looking at the WORD LIST: agency, agent? Wait, no, "agency" is in the list. "Agent" might not be. Let's check the list provided:

WORD LIST includes: agency, agricultural, agent? Wait, the given word list has "agricultural", but not "agent". So maybe use "agency" as a noun. So "Assist academic agency agriculture." But "agriculture" is a noun here. The structure would be Verb (Assist) + Adjective (academic) + Noun1 (agency) + Noun2 (agriculture). That works.

But wait, "agricultural" is an adjective. So if I want to use "agricultural", it should be modified by a noun. For example, "Assist academic agency agriculturally." But "agriculturally" isn't in the list; the adjective is "agricultural". Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe another verb. Let's try "Authorize". Adjective: "annual". Nouns: "area", "army". So "Authorize annual area army." That fits: Authorize (verb) + annual (adjective) + area (noun) + army (noun). Good. Sentence 2: Authorize annual area army.

Continuing this way, using each word once. This will take a while, but following the structure strictly. Need to ensure that each sentence uses exactly four words, in the correct order, and no repeats.

Let's proceed step by step, creating each sentence while keeping track of used words.
