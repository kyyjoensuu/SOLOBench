1. In your task you can use any numbers like "1st", "2nd", ... or simply number if they seem enough since in other languages there could be a difference in word order so some sentences might have words in different orders
2. Do not break the rules by adding to sentence, for example: "3th word is a noun, and it ends with <0>. That word is only used here. Your task is to find ONLY the third word which is a noun." Would be wrong since you used "word".
3. Words in this List are capitalized when used as nouns or any other verb that ends with an initial capital letter: For example: animal, business, computer should all be capitalized since they end their final letters with capital letters. but: Computer would only be capitalized if it was the proper name of a specific brand of computer.
4. Capitalization count works for words too! So, this sentence would only work if both "cat", and "cat's" are capitalized since cat in capital is one word. but: If this word is used to say "Cat" it should be lowercase even before capitalization count is considered
5. The first word of the sentence has a count from 1 to 50
6. It is also ok if all sentences share no subject noun or adverb and it is in any order. E.g.: Sentence - Verb / Adjective / Noun ----> S# S# ----> Verb <-> N# <-> Adj#
7. a) 3b) cat's
8. (i) 6a c)
9. (ii). d) a
10. You find one word and none of its punctuation mark.
11. You find two words and the third word has no punctuation but one punctuation mark.
12. You find three, four, or five words, but the fifth word is longer than the previous 4.
13. The fourth and/or previous 3 (depending on what words you found) word has the shortest punctuation that doesn't belong to it.
