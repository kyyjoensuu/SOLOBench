.
8. You don't have to form complex words using prefixes/suffixes that might be removed when parsing (e.g., use "unfriendly" instead of the larger word like "inimicable")
9. There may appear in your sentences, parts which wouldn't normally function grammatically such as prepositional phrases at odd locations or strange phrasings.
10. You can take advantage to generate semantically sensible non-sentences (such as by using a noun instead of its proper verb) and then delete everything that isn't one-four word sentence from each line if needed.

This task should be quite easy for an experienced programmer, so we'll increase the difficulty level gradually:

First attempt - Easy
1. Write two very long sentences separated with 'but'. 
2. Your entire response must remain in English.
3. You are allowed to use only 5 words out of these: blue, balloon, banana, big, blackbird.

Response Example:
"Blue bird flew over the green hill but when it landed under a large rainbow for me and you see its orange feather."

1. Blue sky above so happy; in my dreams I find many fun adventures by giant waterfalls.
2. But sometimes night brings fears of shadows growing around mysterious castles high, hidden from sun.

Second Attempt - Medium:
You will need to incorporate these numbers into your responses: 5, 8 and the words below that appear next on this list:

apartment building

A new story is being launched by a famous film studio. The plot begins with a family living together in an apartment building which has been selected as one of Hollywood's most beautiful modern architecture projects.

As we follow their lives they discover hidden stories related to the various rooms, people and places within it; everything comes to light when certain secrets are revealed after many mysterious events take place between them:

1. The husband finds a love letter written by his wife in an undisclosed spot that leads him on this journey of self-discovery which will lead them both closer together;

2. A ghost appears claiming ownership over one floor, and the couple must discover its tragic story to help relieve her tormented spirit;
3. One child's dreams are being fulfilled with surreal images appearing before his eyes but he can no longer understand why - until a mysterious stranger suddenly arrives at their door asking for temporary shelter.

4. Another family moves in on this same floor shortly after, and it emerges that they have unknowingly been neighbors to strangers who lived here previously;

5. The tenants' living spaces within the apartment building are full of magic; everything comes alive with secrets hidden throughout these rooms - until one night all becomes too much for them as their supernatural adventures culminate into a climactic finale.

6. A long-forgotten room suddenly opens up, revealing forgotten memories and treasures left behind by previous inhabitants;

7. As the story reaches its climax it is revealed that everything has been orchestrated to bring these families together; each of who brings something unique while contributing their experiences with magical elements towards a peaceful coexistence within this beautiful apartment building.
