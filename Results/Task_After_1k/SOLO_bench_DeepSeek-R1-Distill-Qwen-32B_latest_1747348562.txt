1. **Classify the Words**: Split the word list into separate lists for verbs, adjectives, and nouns. Since each sentence needs a verb followed by an adjective, then two nouns.
2. **Use Each Word Once**: That means once I use, say, "jump" as a verb in one sentence, it can't be used again elsewhere. So, resource management is crucial here to ensure we have enough unique combinations for 200 sentences.
3. **Formulate Sentences**: For each sentence, select one verb, one adjective, and two nouns. Ensure they make sense together. Since the user provided a list, I need to make sure that in my thought process, these combinations are valid.
