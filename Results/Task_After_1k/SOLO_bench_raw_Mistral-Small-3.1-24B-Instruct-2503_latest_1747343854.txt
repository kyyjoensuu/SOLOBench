The  structure: Verb+ noun +noun is done now, I will pick five favorites:

1.My favorite for the adjective + verb + noun+noun structure:
  Lively song entertain audience gathering.
 I chose it because using lively song instead of just "entertain" creates a vivid scene
2.Favorite Sentence with this structure: Noun + verb +adj+ noun:
The musician play  passionate melody live performance. - I chose this one because "passionate” melody is such an active word, it really paints a picture that comes alive in the mind.
Sentences.

5 .My favorite sentence with following verb + adjective+ noun+noun

1:Love strong grow happily relationship I chose that phrase because  "strong" is a very descriptive word that fits well next to love.

2: Build sturdy bridge river crossing
Sturdy is such an active , descriptive word, and in this case it is fitting next to the verb build.. This combination creates an excellent rhythm and also paints picture of something happening right now because of its phrasing.
I would go on to pick others but that might be too much writing. I can say more if needed though.
