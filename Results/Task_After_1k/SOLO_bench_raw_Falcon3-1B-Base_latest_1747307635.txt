8. Each answer must follow the structure: Verb + Adjective + Noun + Noun  
9. Do not output any irrelevant words that do not pertain to the activity at all. (For example, if we were doing a task about people having jobs, we would not want our output to also include information like "He's a doctor!" or "She loves math.")
10. If there is more than one answer you must generate ten unique sentences (e.g., instead of listing "I love writing stories and novels", generate a list including "A: I Love Writing Stories, Novels!", "B: I really enjoy to write short stories.", etc.)
7) Do not repeat answers. For example if a person's first answer is "I like dogs because they are friendly," do not present the second answer as two separate responses for "They give me lots of affection"; this would violate rule number seven by repeating the first answer.
8) The first sentence must contain all the vocabulary from the list. Each subsequent sentence should start with a different word from the same list. All sentences must be unique, i.e., not repetitions based on previous words used within their context. So for example, if we use the adjective "big," our next set of sentences could be:
* I have read many big books in my lifetime...
* These books were so large and heavy that they required me to break out my special book-breaking device...
* The only way ever to see what was inside those ancient texts is to get your hands (and maybe toes!) wet while jumping inside the giant bookshelves!
10) If given a set of words, I will generate any sentences containing at least one of them. So for example if you are given the list below: [red, blue, green], then as part of this exercise I want to be sure that at least one sentence contains all elements from the list at multiple stages throughout [e.g., in 3rd position before I give a new word]. Here is an example sentence from my previous generation of task: When I was around 4 years old and my dad bought me this awesome red, blue, green toy car I could race it everywhere because there were no roads or obstacles in our home and we lived on this big flat grassy field which had lots of open spaces between trees.
This is what my previous sentence would look like, after the wordlist was expanded by [blue]: 
[red, blue, green] +  [blue] = 1st letter: R & B words in position 2 => No change, go to next word
[red, blue, gray] +    [gray] = 1st letter: G word in position 4 => Change to Red first since red is the only one of them that starts with red
[red, blue, green] +    [green] = 2nd letter: N word in position 3 => Change to Blue after having "red" as its last letter so now [red, blue, green] and I have chosen [green], which is the only option that doesn't start with red but has green which would make sense in context
[red, blue, black] +    [black] = 3rd letter: B word in position 1 or none of them starting it as no word starts a sentence and so on...
Now here is an example sentence given by your instructions that uses all words from the list at least once and adheres to the other conditions given:
The red, blue, and black sports cars were very expensive but people could buy any of them with their own money.
8) My sentences should always contain [noun] + [adjective], never a combination of [adjective] + adjective, nor multiple-adjectives. For example, when I say that one person loves dogs because they are friendly to animals and happy in social situations, even though this is not possible in reality, then you need to provide a sentence where two independent nouns are combined:
* One person loves dogs because they are happy in social situations & adorable
7) Do not output irrelevant words that do not pertain to the activity at all. For example if we were doing a task about people having jobs, we would not want our output to include information like "He's a doctor!" or "She loves math!".
6) This is one of the most important rules because it allows your output sentence to have the maximum possible amount of meaning per word used. It also ensures that you can keep track of how many total unique words are in these sentences by keeping a running tally rather than relying on an index which will then become outdated if you only reuse some words and ignore others too quickly.
5) Each answer must follow the structure: Verb + Adjective + Noun + Noun
4) Do not attempt to use any tools or code - instead try writing each answer as a separate sentence by hand using standard English grammar rules.
3) If you do not already have multiple answers for the current set of words then generate one at least before moving onto the next set of words. So once you are given an expanded wordlist then don't just use the last word from it for each new list without a first attempt to expand beyond those initial constraints! For example: My first sentence starts out like this "The old lady was sitting on her couch watching television"; and after seeing [colorless
2] in my updated previous generation input I try starting another sentence with no color whatsoever...and so forth until we're all done... And by doing this we keep track of how many different ways you can construct possible answers and give yourself room within which to add new words later on down the road.
