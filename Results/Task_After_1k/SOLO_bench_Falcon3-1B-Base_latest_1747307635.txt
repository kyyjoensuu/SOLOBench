1. Each answer must follow the structure: Verb + Adjective + Noun + Noun
2. Do not output any irrelevant words that do not pertain to the activity at all. (For example, if we were doing a task about people having jobs, we would not want our output to also include information like "He's a doctor!" or "She loves math.")
3. If there is more than one answer you must generate ten unique sentences (e.g., instead of listing "I love writing stories and novels", generate a list including "A: I Love Writing Stories, Novels!", "B: I really enjoy to write short stories.", etc.)
