I think the problem here is not with ChatGPT, but with you and your "requirement". If you simply ask it to generate sentences with four nouns, you could specify it's own numbering system. Even in your example, a sentence could contain more nouns, so it could simply use an existing number for the sentence.

If you want specific information, like a complete list of the nouns used in the sentences, you have that right there in the text, simply by reading it. The computer isn't good at creating data <i>and</i> reading it, though. It can generate the sentences, but not <i>itself</i> analyze them. ChatGPT <i>is</i> an LLM, not AGI.

Also, if you want a specific format for the results, you would have to tell the LLM what it is. If you need a CSV, tell it you need a CSV. If you need a list, tell it you need a list. LLMs are not telepathic.

In any case, the following response looks promising:

The results have a format with only the nouns listed. The first 4 nouns are the sentence title. The rest of the nouns form the sentence:

1.
Nouns:
the,
man,
walked,
park

Sentence:
The man walked in the park.

2.
Nouns:
sun,
shone,
brightly,
daytime

Sentence:
The sun shone brightly during the daytime.

3.
Nouns:
clouds,
blocked,
sun,
early,
evening

Sentence:
Cloudy weather blocked the sun in the early evening.

4.
Nouns:
sky,
turned,
dark,

night

Sentence:
The sky turned dark late in the night.

5.

I think you are doing it wrong. LLM's don't store information in a format that's accessible to you. If you want specific numbers in some specific way, then you have to tell the LLM how to give you that information. You have to be specific. In the case of ChatGPT, it is easier to just extract the information by yourself, reading the generated text and then creating that output using a simple spreadsheet program.

ChatGPT can <i>generate text</i> with numbers in a specific way, and it can <i>manipulate simple text input</i> like you would input for a search engine, but you <i>cannot</i> input any complex information that's already formatted and expect it to be able to process it and manipulate it as you think it would.

This LLM's are just fancy text generators. That's all.</blockquote>

However I want a different way to work in a model rather than build a model on top of a model. Rather I want to build a different model and then see the result. I would do this because a model is better if it can be built in a different way to create a different model.

However I have never seen this way of doing this before so it's not possible to build a model in this way.

However I can see this way of doing this before, so I want to see this way of doing this.

However I haven't seen this way of doing this before, so I don't want to build this way of doing this.
This is not how it works. Machines do not read like humans and they do not think of information in terms of numbers. You have to tell a machine that you want a CSV or a JSON or a SQL and that you want it structured in a specific way. You can give it some instructions like this:

<CSV>
N1,N2,Title,Title
N3,N4,Sentence,Sentence
N3,N4,Sentence,Sentence
N3,N4,Sentence,Sentence
N3,N4,Sentence,Sentence
N3,N4,Sentence,Sentence
</CSV>

Also, you have to be careful to give clear instructions about what do you want. The following example only uses some words and does not give you a title, as in the example that you gave:

<CSV>
N1,N2,Sentence,Sentence
N3,N4,Sentence,Sentence
N3,N4,Sentence,Sentence
N3,N4,Sentence,Sentence
N3,N4,Sentence,Sentence
N3,N4,Sentence,Sentence
</CSV>

If there are a lot of requirements, you have to be specific. If your instructions are not clear, you can not expect a correct result:

The above example is very clear that you want a CSV with 1000 nouns. The following instructions give an ambiguous instruction, that in this case are unclear to follow and the result is only a list of nouns, not a CSV:

<CSV>
N1,N2,Sentence,Sentence
N3,N4,Sentence,Sentence
N3,N4,Sentence,Sentence
N3,N4,Sentence,Sentence
N3,N4,Sentence,Sentence
N3,N4,Sentence,Sentence
</CSV>

If you want a different type of format, you have to give some instructions. The above example was for a CSV. If you want something else, tell the computer what do you want:

<JSON>
[
[N1,N2,N3,N4],
[N1,N2,N3,N4],
[N1,N2,N3,N4],
[N1,N2,N3,N4],
[N1,N2,N3,N4],
[N1,N2,N3,N4],
[N1,N2,N3,N4],
[N1,N2,N3,N4],
[N1,N2,N3,N4],
[N1,N2,N3,N4]
]
You can give this computer instructions of whatever format of data do you want. This way can output a JSON, CSV, a SQL database, whatever it suits your needs. Just tell it what do you need, and it will do it for you. The following example would create a SQL database with one million rows, and a million records. You can tell it the table name, which in this case would be <i>mytable</i>. Then you give it each column name, and the type for each column, then in the body of the SQL you give it a list of words.

<SQL>
CREATE TABLE mytable
(
title varchar(255),
sentence varchar(1000)
)

INSERT INTO mytable
title,
sentence

VALUES
word1,
words 2
word3,
words 4
word5,
words 6
word7,

The problem is that humans use language in a way that is difficult to read in a way that humans can read. This is because humans do not read the language in a way that it would be difficult to read, but they do not think of language in the way that it would be difficult to read. They do not think how is it easy to read it, but they do not think how is it difficult for a human to read it. If you give a computer some instructions like this:

- I want a list of sentences containing some nouns.
- I want a list of titles that contain some words.
- I want a list of words that contain some nouns.

Then the computer would think that the human wants a list of words, but the humans think that the computer would think a list of words, but humans think a list of words that have some nouns. The computer would think that the humans want a list of words that contain some nouns and also some words and also some nouns, but humans do not think that computers are smart enough to think that they have smarts to think how to think what they think, even if they think something, because they do not think a computer is very intelligent.

Humans can think of an argument, but they don't think that the argument can be thought. Humans can think that the argument can be thought, but they don't think that the argument can be thought, even though humans do not think how the argument is thought. They think a lot of things, but they don't think about the things that they think about.

If you were to explain the concept to a computer, and it would then have to explain it back to you, you would have to explain it back to it and then explain it back to yourself, explaining it back to yourself and to yourself and to itself and back to itsself and to you and to yourself, explaining it back to yourself and to itself and to yourself and back to itself and to itself and back to itself and back to itself and to itself and to yourself and back to yourself and to itself and to yourself and back to itself and back to itself and to yourself and back to yourself and back to yourself and back to yourself and back to itself and back to yourself and to yourself and to yourself and to yourself and to yourself and to yourself and to yourself and to yourself and back to yourself and back to itself and to yourself and to yourself and to yourse</blockquote>

The problem is that ChatGPT is not trained in how to give you the information that you want. It has been trained in how to give you the information it wants to give you, not the information you want.

If you want to give ChatGPT information that it has not yet been trained to give you, you have two choices:

1. You give ChatGPT some "requirements" and then tell ChatGPT how to give you that information.
2. You tell ChatGPT how to give you the information you want.

Choice 1 is always bad, because ChatGPT is already trained on how to provide the information you want. It's already giving it to you. The only thing it can do is give you the information in a different way. This way is always different. It's always going to give you the information, but it'll take you many more steps to get that information.

In some cases you may be able to use some of these methods with some of these methods.

A good example is when you want to get a lot of information. You want a lot of information from another computer. You want that information in a way that is different from what you give to another computer.

You may be able to do some of these methods, but it's not something that ChatGPT can do without training. It's not trained in how to do it. It is not trained in how to do a lot of different kind of things.

If you are going to use this method, you should ask someone else to do it for you. It is not something that ChatGPT can do for you.</blockquote>
