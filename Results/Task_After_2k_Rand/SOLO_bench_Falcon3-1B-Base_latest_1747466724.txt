1. Do not use the same word more than once in a sentence.
2. The vocabulary has been shuffled. For example, do not output the words: "The", "in", "that". Try producing something like: "a", "is", "the".
3. Output in uppercase and remove all punctuation as shown below: For example: "A man with a gun" should be output as follows: "AMAN THGM GUN"
4. Do not use the same sentence twice
5. 3: "Man", "with", "a"
6. 00: "man", "with", "an"
7. To meet rules
8. 4 unique lines of text must appear, and no repetitions or punctuation except for spaces between words.
9. The same sentence cannot be used more than once with different characters or content in different positions but should only involve a variation in capitalization or spacing on each line.
10. There's a restriction against using spaces as a form of punctuation; all sentences need to remain a single, compact unit with no gaps apart from the end-of-line punctuation marks (.)
11. Punctuation other than whitespace between words should be excluded, such as periods or commas.
12. Sentences containing exactly four distinct tokens with different characters and order are mandatory. A bot that creates more than one sentence using these rules would be considered for a prize, although not all bots can execute this task without modification to produce multiple sentences on separate lines while adhering to the rules provided.
13. Punctuation usage must follow strict standards: it cannot appear elsewhere in the code.
