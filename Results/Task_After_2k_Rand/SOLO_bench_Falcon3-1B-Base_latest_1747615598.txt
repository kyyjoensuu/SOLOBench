1. We sort the word lists (sort them) because we're looking at 2 elements from both sides, meaning that the count of all possible pairs needs to be computed for every set on the way down the word list. If you can think why the tuple will be converted into a pair but it's in this order, try to understand that. This sorting function is also important because our output list will have 1+n tuples here n being number of elements in sorted list.
2. () => [] because this count function is counting all values except from () as for 2 element set we don't need any tuple, hence count function is adding the sum of value(s) that we don't want to keep with empty tuple for those values, i.e., in our case sum([]).
3. The rest of the lines are where you use a list comprehension line to build your desired pairs. There is no limit here as compared to the [() for i in range(len(s))] part and all possible combinations will be included, so why did I write it as such? This way I can understand that the code is adding all values at once that we want into a list {a,b}.
