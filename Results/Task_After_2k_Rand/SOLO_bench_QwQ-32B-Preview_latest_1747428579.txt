1. **Identify Parts of Speech**: First, I needed to categorize the words into verbs, adjectives, and nouns. This is crucial because each sentence requires specific parts of speech in a particular order.
2. **Ensure Uniqueness**: Since no word can be reused, I had to keep track of which words have been used in previous sentences.
3. **Maintain Structure**: Each sentence must strictly follow the Verb + Adjective + Noun + Noun format.
4. **Word Count per Sentence**: Each sentence should contain exactly four words.
