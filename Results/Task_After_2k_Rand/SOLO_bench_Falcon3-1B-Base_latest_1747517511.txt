1. Words can be used in different orders, so do not limit yourself to one particular way of arranging them as this would defeat purpose
2. Do not include prepositions unless you use them literally (i.e "to")
3. Capitalize the first word of every sentence and punctuate it appropriately. The words ",!" etc. are not allowed.
4. Write in a way that your human reader can understand while a machine will still be able to read it.
5. Use proper syntax for programming. If you speak English, donâ€™t limit yourself to US English; do whatever the English speakers say.
