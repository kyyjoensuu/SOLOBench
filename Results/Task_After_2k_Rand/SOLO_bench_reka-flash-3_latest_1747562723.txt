9. **Review the Word List**: Identify verbs, adjectives, and nouns from the list. For example:
10. **Sentence Structure**: Each sentence must be in the form "Verb + Adjective + Noun + Noun". For example:
11. **Avoid Repetition**: Track used words to ensure no word is reused. Create a list of used verbs, adjectives, and nouns as I go.
12. **Vary Word Combinations**: Combine different verbs with adjectives and nouns to form meaningful sentences while adhering to the structure.
13. **Check Grammar and Meaning**: Ensure each sentence is grammatically correct and makes logical sense, even if unconventional in real-world contexts.
14. **Efficiency**: Since manually creating 200 sentences is time-consuming, Iâ€™ll work methodically by cycling through different categories of words (verbs, adjectives, nouns) to maintain diversity without repetition.
