Here is an example of the first few sentences:

1. Iraqi Thanksgiving celebration cheap 
2. Accounting adjustment country native 
3. Alliance anger harassment refugee 

Now, I need to make sure that each sentence follows the structure Verb + Adjective + Noun + Noun and uses unique words from the list. Let's start by breaking down each word in the list to see which ones fit into verbs, adjectives, nouns, etc.

First, identify verbs: adjust, assure, differ, disclose, divide, educate, feed, find, host, identify, impress, know, lend, make, modify, move, relate, relieve, restrict, sustain, take, treat, turn. Wait, some are in the list as single words but need to be conjugated? The example sentences use base verbs like assure, adjust, etc., so probably use base form.

Adjectives: average, barely, brown, cheap, colonial, comparable, democratic (wait, democracy is a noun), equal, former, hostile, incumbent, native, partly, substantial, superior, tall, ten, useful, wealthy. Wait, some words like 'barely' are adverbs? The example has 'Thanksgiving celebration cheap' where 'cheap' is adjective. So need to check which words can be adjectives.

Nouns: Iraqi, Thanksgiving, accounting, adjustment, agency, alliance, anger, appearance, arrow, assure, average, barely, bedroom, bias, bloody, bowl, brown, button, car, celebration, citizen, closer, colonial, conception, consequently, context, cooperative, country, criticism, cycle, decade, democracy, desk, differ, disclose, divide, dragon, duty, educate, eleven, enemy, equal, every, executive, export, faith, feed, finding, floor, former, friend, game, giant, graduation, guarantee, harassment, height, his, hostile, identify, impression, infant, inspector, interaction, invite, joy, know, lawmaker, lend, line, loot, make, mask, medium, mill, modify, move, native, news, novel, off, operation, ought, package, partly, penalty, philosophy, place, pole, post, premise, priority, progress, provide, quality, random, reason, ref., refugee, relieve, republican, restrict, right, row, sanction, scream, self, several, ship, sigh, size, snap, something, specify, square, straw, substantial, superior, sustain, tall, ten, theme, threshold, tolerate, trading, treat, turn, unexpected, useful, vessel, voting, wealthy, wherever, wire, wrap, yard.

So some words can be verbs and nouns. For example, 'adjust' is a verb and 'adjustment' is a noun. Need to use each word only once, so if we use 'adjust' as a verb in one sentence, then 'adjustment' can't be used again.

This is going to take some careful planning. Let's start constructing sentences following the structure.

1. Iraqi Thanksgiving celebration cheap (example given)
2. Accounting adjustment country native
3. Alliance anger harassment refugee

Now, proceed step by step:

Next verbs: adjust, assure, differ, disclose, divide, educate, feed, find, host, identify, impress, know, lend, make, modify, move, relate, relieve, restrict, sustain, take, treat, turn.

Let's pick 'adjust' as verb. Then need an adjective followed by two nouns. So structure: adjust + [adjective] + [noun] + [noun]. Let's use adjectives from the list. For example, 'adjust average car country'? But words must be exactly from the list. Wait, words like 'average' are adjectives. So:

4. Adjust average car country

But wait, 'car' and 'country' can both be nouns here.

Next verb: assure. Then an adjective: perhaps 'barely' (but barely is an adverb? Hmm. The example uses 'cheap' as adjective. Maybe some words that are adjectives. Let's check the list again. Words like 'average', 'barely' might need to be used appropriately. Maybe 'assure substantial export vessel'?

5. Assure substantial export vessel

Assure is verb, substantial is adjective, export and vessel are nouns.

Next verb: differ. Adjective: perhaps 'colonial'. Then two nouns.

6. Differ colonial agency inspector

Differ (verb) + colonial (adjective, but 'colonial' can also be a noun? Let's confirm. Colonial as adjective means relating to the colonies. So 'differ colonial agency inspector' makes sense.

Next verb: disclose. Adjective: 'hostile'?

7. Disclose hostile news context

Disclose (verb) + hostile (adjective) + news (noun) + context (noun)

Next verb: divide. Adjective: 'cooperative'? Wait, cooperative is an adjective meaning working together. So:

8. Divide cooperative policy framework? Wait, but words must be from the list. Let's see. Available nouns: agency, alliance, etc. Hmm.

Wait, the word list includes 'cooperative' as a noun (since it's in the list), but maybe as an adjective. Let me check. The example uses 'cheap' as adjective. So 'divide cooperative country democracy'? But 'country' and 'democracy' are nouns. That might work.

9. Divide cooperative country democracy

Next verb: educate. Adjective: 'equal'

10. Educate equal graduate program? Wait, but the words must be from the list. Available nouns: education isn't in the list, so maybe 'educate equal child parent'? But 'child' and 'parent' aren't in the list. Let's look for other nouns. Maybe 'educate equal citizen law'? 'Citizen' and 'law' are in the list.

11. Educate equal citizen law

Next verb: feed. Adjective: 'self'?

12. Feed self fish bowl

Self is an adjective here (referring to oneself), but 'fish' isn't in the word list. Available nouns: arrow, car, country, etc. Maybe 'feed self arrow car'? Doesn't make much sense. Alternatively, maybe 'feed self bowl straw'? Straw is in the list.

13. Feed self bowl straw

Next verb: find. Adjective: 'unexpected'

14. Find unexpected joy secret? 'Secret' not in list. Use words from the list. Maybe 'find unexpected joy scream'? Scream is a noun.

15. Find unexpected joy scream

Next verb: host (but 'host' isn't in the word list. Wait, checking the list: 'inspector', 'interaction', 'invite'... Maybe 'hostile' is used as adjective earlier. Next available verb: identify.

16. Identify neighbor problem solution? Not in list. Use words from list. Maybe 'identify arrow dragon line'? Doesn't make sense. Alternatively, 'identify host problem solution'? No. Maybe 'identify enemy ally friend'? But 'enemy', 'ally', 'friend' are nouns. Structure is Verb + Adjective + Noun + Noun. So adjective needed. Maybe 'identify hostile enemy friend'.

17. Identify hostile enemy friend

Next verb: impress. Adjective: 'sustainable'

18. Impress sustainable progress economy? Economy not in list. Available nouns: country, agency, etc. Maybe 'impress sustainable progress country'.

19. Impress sustainable progress country

Next verb: know. Adjective: 'random'

20. Know random fact truth? Truth isn't in the list. Use words like 'news', 'reason', 'law', etc. 'Know random fact reason'? Fact not in list. Available nouns: agency, adjustment, etc. Maybe 'know random news reality'? Reality not in list. Hmm. Maybe 'know random reason solution'? Solution isn't in list. Alternatively, 'know random law penalty'.

21. Know random law penalty

Next verb: lend. Adjective: 'useful'

22. Lend useful book money? Book not in list. Use available nouns: car, country, etc. 'Lend useful car loan'? Loan not in list. Maybe 'lend useful money debt'? Debt not in list. Alternatively, 'lend useful package support'.

23. Lend useful package support

Next verb: make. Adjective: 'former'

24. Make former product design? Product not in list. Use available nouns: adjustment, alliance, etc. 'Make former alliance decision'.

25. Make former alliance decision

Next verb: modify. Adjective: 'superior'

26. Modify superior system process? System and process aren't in the list. Available nouns: car, country, etc. Maybe 'modify superior car engine'? Engine isn't in the list. Alternatively, 'modify superior law rule'.

27. Modify superior law rule

Next verb: move. Adjective: 'hostile'

28. Move hostile army base? Army not in list. Use available nouns: country, agency, etc. 'Move hostile agency operation'.

29. Move hostile agency operation

Next verb: relate. Not in the word list. Next verb: relieve. Adjective: 'temporary' – not in list. Available adjectives: 'barely', 'colonial', 'cooperative', etc. Maybe 'relieve barely tension pressure'? Tension and pressure not in list. Use available nouns: 'relieve barely stress situation'.

30. Relieve barely stress situation

Wait, 'stress' isn't in the word list. Available nouns: agency, country, etc. Maybe 'relieve barely anger criticism'.

31. Relieve barely anger criticism

Next verb: restrict. Adjective: 'export'

32. Restrict export policy law? Policy and law are in the list.

33. Restrict export policy law

Next verb: sustain. Adjective: 'substantial'

34. Sustain substantial growth economy? Economy not in list. Use available nouns: country, agency, etc. 'Sustain substantial growth country'.

35. Sustain substantial growth country

Next verb: take. Not in the word list. Next verb: treat. Adjective: 'unfair' – not in list. Available adjectives: 'equal', 'former', 'hostile', etc. 'Treat former enemy friend'.

36. Treat former enemy friend

Next verb: turn. Adjective: 'unexpected'

37. Turn unexpected page story? Page and story not in list. Use available nouns: 'turn unexpected event outcome'.

38. Turn unexpected event outcome

Continuing this process, carefully using each word once and adhering to the structure. This will take some time, but let's proceed step by step.
