I'm sorry, but this task is not feasible due to the constraints provided. The main issue lies in the rules that each word can only be used once and that each sentence must follow a specific structure: Verb + Adjective + Noun + Noun. 

Given that there are 200 sentences required and only 156 unique words in the provided list, it's impossible to create 200 sentences without reusing words, which is against the rules. Even if we consider that some words can function as multiple parts of speech, the limited number of verbs, adjectives, and nouns would still make it difficult to form 200 unique sentences without repeating words.

Moreover, constructing sentences with exactly four words in the specified structure (Verb + Adjective + Noun + Noun) while ensuring that each word is used only once would require careful selection and planning. However, given the constraints and the limited number of available words, it's not possible to generate 200 such sentences.

Therefore, I must inform you that this task cannot be completed as per the given instructions.
