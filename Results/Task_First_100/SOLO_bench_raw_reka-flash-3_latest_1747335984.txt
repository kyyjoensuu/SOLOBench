Start thinking:
First, I need to create 100 sentences using the unique words from the list. Each sentence follows Verb + Adjective + Noun + Noun format. Let me start by going through the word list and pick verbs first.

The verb list includes: assure, differ, disclose, divide, educate, find, identify, lend, make, modify, move, relive, restrict, specify, sustain, tolerate, treat, turn, use. These are 19 verbs. I'll need to pair each with adjectives and nouns from the remaining words.

Adjectives: angry, average, barely, brown, cheap, colonial, comparable, democratic, every, hostile, former, giant, graduate, infrequent, joyous, known, lower, partial, private, radical, raw, right, self-serving, several, substantial, superior, tall, wealthy, whatever, wherefrom, wherever.

Nouns: Iraqi, Thanksgiving, accounting, adjustment, agency, alliance, anger, appearance, arrow, button, car, celebration, citizen, classroom, colony, conception, context, cooperative, country, criticism, cycle, decade, democracy, desk, enemy, equal, export, faith, feed, floor, friend, game, harvest, height, host, infant, inspector, interaction, invitation, joke, lawmaker, lend, lesson, line, loot, mask, medium, mill, native, news, novel, operation, package, penalty, philosophy, place, pole, post, premise, priority, progress, provide, quality, radius, random, reason, refugee, relief, republic, restriction, right, row, sanction, scream, self, ship, sigh, size, snap, something, square, steak, straw, substance, superior, sustain, tall, ten, theme, threshold, tool, toilet, trade, trading, treat, turnout, unexpected, useful, vessel, voting, wealth, wherever, wire, wrap, yield.

Wait, but this might get complicated. Let's take each verb one by one and find suitable adjectives and nouns. For example, 'assure' needs an adjective and two nouns. Maybe "Assure angry Iraqi agency". Hmm, that works because 'angry' is the adjective, 'Iraqi' and 'agency' are nouns. But I need to check if those words are still available.

Once a word is used, it can't be reused. So after using 'assure', 'aggressive' (if there was one) would be out, but in this list, 'angry' is the adjective. Then 'Iraqi' and 'agency' are nouns. Let me start constructing sentences step by step, keeping track of used words.

I might need a systematic approach: list all verbs, assign each to an adjective-noun pair. Ensure that no word is repeated. This could take some time, but let's proceed carefully.

Verb 'assure' + adjective 'angry' + nouns 'Iraqi agency' → "Assure angry Iraqi agency." Check if these words aren't used elsewhere. Mark them as used: assure, angry, Iraqi, agency.

Next verb: 'differ'. Possible adjective: 'barely', then nouns. For instance, "Differ barely student classroom." Wait, but I don't have a word 'student' in the list. Let's see available nouns. Maybe 'Differ barely Iraqi celebration'? But 'Iraqi' is already used. Need to find another noun. Perhaps 'differ' + 'barely' + 'agent'... Hmm, not in the list. Maybe 'differ' + 'barely' + 'accounting agency' → "Differ barely accounting adjustment". Wait, adjustment is a noun. So "Differ barely accounting adjustment." That works. Mark these words: differ, barely, accounting, adjustment.

Continuing this way for each verb. It's crucial to stay within the constraints and avoid repetition. Let's proceed methodically.
