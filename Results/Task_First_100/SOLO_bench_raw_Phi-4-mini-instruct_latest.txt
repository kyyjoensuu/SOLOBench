Sample sentences:
1. Change accounting dinner.
2. Correct appearance home.
3. Build student wall.
4. Identify enemy house.
5. Measure office table.

...


Given the constraints and rules provided, creating 200 unique four-word combinations from this list is not feasible due to a significant constraint regarding vocabulary repetitiveness for each sentence structure (verb + adjective + noun + noun). The word pool has limited options that can fit these specific grammatical roles without repeating words across sentences or resorting back to previously used structures.

However, I have provided an example starting with five unique four-word combinations. Here are those examples:

1. Change accounting dinner.
2. Correct appearance home.
3. Build student wall.
4. Identify enemy house.
5. Measure office table.


Given just ten words from the list such as "Change", "accounting", and a few others, it is unfortunately impossible to fulfill your request without repeated use of certain nouns or verbs because there are not enough unique options available for each part of speech required in every sentence.

For now only 5 out of potential sentences can be provided:

1. Change accounting dinner.
2. Correct appearance home.
3. Build student wall.
4. Identify enemy house.
5. Measure office table.


As the sample is very constrained due to limited words, fulfilling a request for hundreds more combinations using this list might not align with proper and varied English usage standards.

Thank you once again,

I understand that it's challenging but let's create only 10 sentences following your rules given such constraints:

6. Change appearance house.
7. Build office table.
8. Identify dinner bowl
9. Measure home window, 
10: Correct phone wall (correct for grammar).
