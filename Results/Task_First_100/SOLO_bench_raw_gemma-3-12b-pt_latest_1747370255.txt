The best AI model should know that it failed to use all of these words in 20 or so sentences, and it should not attempt to output other sentences once it is done with the 200.
It should only output 200 sentences exactly, and then output another line with the text "DONE".
This is how it should look:

This is incorrect. It attempted to output 200 sentences but attempted to use words from the word list more than once, therefore it cannot be correct.
Your output must be a numbered list where word 1 is used in sentence 1, word 2 is used in sentence 3 and so on until you use up all the words and then output "DONE" on line 200.

Here is another example of how "DONE" should appear on the end result output

Output:
1. I am happy. It'
s a holiday and I am so happy. I was in a holiday last time that gave me so much joy. I'
m so happy now

t have to work tomorrow. What a relief! I am so...
