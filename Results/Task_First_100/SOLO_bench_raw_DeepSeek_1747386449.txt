Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants 200 sentences following the structure Verb + Adjective + Noun + Noun, using each word exactly once from the provided word list. First, I need to make sure I understand the rules correctly. Each sentence must have four words, each used only once, and the structure is strict: Verb, then Adjective, then two Nouns. 

First, I should separate the word list into verbs, adjectives, and nouns. But wait, the user didn't categorize the words, so I have to figure out which words are verbs, adjectives, or nouns. Let me go through the list mentally.

Verbs might include words like assure, differ, disclose, divide, educate, feed, identify, invite, know, lend, make, modify, move, ought (though "ought" is a modal verb, maybe not usable here), provide, relieve, restrict, scream, snap, specify, sustain, tolerate, treat, turn, wrap. Wait, "ought" is tricky because it's used with "to", but the sentences can't have extra words. Maybe exclude it. Other verbs: educate, feed, identify, invite, know, lend, make, modify, move, provide, relieve, restrict, scream, snap, specify, sustain, tolerate, treat, turn, wrap. Let's list those as possible verbs.

Adjectives: Iraqi, Thanksgiving (maybe proper nouns, but could be adjectives?), accounting, adjustment, agency, alliance, anger, appearance, arrow, average, barely, bedroom, bias, bloody, bowl, brown, button, car, celebration, cheap, citizen, closer, colonial, comparable, conception, consequently, context, cooperative, country, criticism, cycle, decade, democracy, desk, differ, disclose, divide, dragon, duty, educate, eleven, enemy, equal, every, executive, export, faith, feed, finding, floor, former, friend, game, giant, graduation, guarantee, harassment, height, his, hostile, identify, impression, infant, inspector, interaction, invite, joy, know, lawmaker, lend, line, loot, make, mask, medium, mill, modify, move, native, news, novel, off, operation, ought, package, partly, penalty, philosophy, place, pole, post, premise, priority, progress, provide, quality, random, reason, refugee, relieve, republican, restrict, right, row, sanction, scream, self, several, ship, sigh, size, snap, something, specify, square, steak, straw, substantial, superior, sustain, tall, ten, theme, threshold, tolerate, trading, treat, turn, unexpected, useful, vessel, voting, wealthy, wherever, wire, wrap. Wait, this is the entire list. But no, the user said not to output the entire word list. So I need to mentally categorize each word.

Wait, the user's word list includes nouns, adjectives, and verbs. For example, "adjustment" is a noun, "Iraqi" can be an adjective, "Thanksgiving" is a noun but maybe used as an adjective. "Cheap" is an adjective, "brown" is an adjective. "Car" is a noun. So the task is to parse each word into its possible parts of speech.

This is going to be time-consuming. Let me start by listing out the verbs first. From the word list, verbs are: assure, differ, disclose, divide, educate, feed, identify, invite, know, lend, make, modify, move, provide, relieve, restrict, scream, snap, specify, sustain, tolerate, treat, turn, wrap. Let's confirm: "assure" is a verb, "differ" is a verb, "disclose" verb, "divide" verb, "educate" verb, "feed" verb, "identify" verb, "invite" verb, "know" verb, "lend" verb, "make" verb, "modify" verb, "move" verb, "provide" verb, "relieve" verb, "restrict" verb, "scream" verb, "snap" verb, "specify" verb, "sustain" verb, "tolerate" verb, "treat" verb, "turn" verb, "wrap" verb. That's 24 verbs. But we need 200 sentences, each with a unique verb. Wait, but the user's word list may have more verbs. Let me check again. Maybe "adjustment" is a noun, "agency" noun, "alliance" noun, "anger" noun, etc. So the verbs are limited. Wait, 24 verbs would only allow 24 sentences, but the user wants 200. So perhaps I missed some verbs. Let's re-examine the word list.

Other possible verbs: "post" can be a verb, "ship" as a verb, "trading" as a gerund but maybe not, "export" as a verb, "random" is an adjective, "sanction" as a verb, "wire" as a verb, "loot" as a verb, "sigh" as a verb, "find" (but "finding" is a noun here), "operate" but "operation" is a noun. Hmm. Maybe "snap" is a verb, "wrap" is a verb. Wait, maybe "guarantee" is a verb. Let's add that. So "guarantee" is a verb. "Restrict" is a verb. "Sustain" verb. "Tolerate" verb. "Modify" verb. "Specify" verb. "Relieve" verb. "Provide" verb. "Move" verb. "Make" verb. "Lend" verb. "Know" verb. "Invite" verb. "Identify" verb. "Feed" verb. "Educate" verb. "Divide" verb. "Disclose" verb. "Differ" verb. "Assure" verb. "Treat" verb. "Turn" verb. "Wrap" verb. "Scream" verb. "Snap" verb. "Restrict" verb. "Sanction" verb (if allowed). "Ship" verb. "Post" verb. "Wire" verb. "Loot" verb. "Sigh" verb. That's more. Let's count again. Assure, differ, disclose, divide, educate, feed, identify, invite, know, lend, make, modify, move, provide, relieve, restrict, sanction, ship, post, wire, loot, sigh, scream, snap, specify, sustain, tolerate, treat, turn, wrap, guarantee. That's 31 verbs. Still not enough for 200 sentences. There's a problem here because the number of available verbs is limited. Wait, maybe some words can be used as verbs even if they're primarily nouns. For example, "ship" can be a verb. "Mask" as a verb? But "mask" is in the word list as a noun. Hmm. The user's rules say to use words exactly as they appear in the list. So if "ship" is in the list as a noun, but can also be a verb, is that allowed? The rules say to use words exactly as they appear, so if "ship" is a noun in the list, but can function as a verb, maybe it's permissible. Same with "post", "wire", etc. So perhaps more verbs can be extracted. Let's try to list all possible verbs from the word list:

Verbs: adjust (but "adjustment" is a noun), assure, differ, disclose, divide, educate, feed, guarantee, identify, invite, know, lend, make, modify, move, post, provide, relieve, restrict, sanction, scream, ship, sigh, snap, specify, sustain, tolerate, treat, turn, wire, wrap, loot. That's 32 verbs. Still, 200 sentences would require 200 verbs, which is impossible. Therefore, there's a mistake here. The user must have provided enough verbs, but perhaps I'm miscounting. Wait, maybe the word list includes more verbs. Let me check again.

Looking at the word list: "assure", "differ", "disclose", "divide", "educate", "feed", "identify", "invite", "know", "lend", "make", "modify", "move", "provide", "relieve", "restrict", "scream", "snap", "specify", "sustain", "tolerate", "treat", "turn", "wrap", "guarantee", "post", "ship", "sanction", "wire", "loot", "sigh". That's 31 verbs. Even if I include "random" as a verb (which it's not), or others, it's not enough. So there's a contradiction here. The user wants 200 sentences, each with a unique verb, but the word list doesn't have 200 verbs. Therefore, the task is impossible as described. But the user must have intended for the word list to have enough verbs. Wait, perhaps I'm missing some verbs. Let me go through the word list again carefully:

So verbs are: assure, differ, disclose, divide, educate, feed, guarantee, identify, invite, know, lend, make, modify, move, post, provide, relieve, restrict, sanction, scream, ship, sigh, snap, specify, sustain, tolerate, treat, turn, wire, wrap, loot, export, place, reason. Wait, "export" can be a verb. "Place" as a verb. "Reason" as a verb. "Loot" as a verb. "Wire" as a verb. "Sanction" as a verb. That adds a few more. Let's count again:

1. assure
2. differ
3. disclose
4. divide
5. educate
6. feed
7. guarantee
8. identify
9. invite
10. know
11. lend
12. make
13. modify
14. move
15. post
16. provide
17. relieve
18. restrict
19. sanction
20. scream
21. ship
22. sigh
23. snap
24. specify
25. sustain
26. tolerate
27. treat
28. turn
29. wire
30. wrap
31. loot
32. export
33. place
34. reason

That's 34 verbs. Still not enough for 200 sentences. This suggests that the task is impossible as per the given word list. But the user must have intended for it to be possible, so perhaps I made a mistake in identifying verbs. Let me check again. Are there any other words that can function as verbs? For example, "random" is an adjective, "tall" adjective, "cheap" adjective. "Progress" is a noun, but can be a verb. Wait, "progress" is in the word list as a noun, but can it be used as a verb? The rules say to use words exactly as they appear. So if "progress" is listed as a noun, using it as a verb would violate rule 1. So no. Similarly, "reason" is in the list as a noun, but can be a verb. The user's rule 1 says to use words exactly as they appear in the list. So if "reason" is in the list as a noun, using it as a verb might be allowed if it's the same spelling. For example, "reason" as a verb is okay. Same with "ship", "post", etc. So maybe "reason" is a verb here. That adds one more. Similarly, "treat" is a verb. "Restrict" is a verb. Let's see. Even with that, we're still at around 34 verbs. 34 verbs would allow 34 sentences, each with a unique verb. But the user wants 200. This indicates a problem. Therefore, either the user made a mistake in the word list, or I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the structure is Verb + Adjective + Noun + Noun, but the two nouns can be different. So each sentence uses one verb, one adjective, and two nouns. The constraint is that each word is used only once across all sentences. So the total number of words in the list must be at least 4*200=800 words. But the provided word list is much shorter. Let me count the words in the list. The word list has:

Iraqi, Thanksgiving, accounting, adjustment, agency, alliance, anger, appearance, arrow, assure, average, barely, bedroom, bias, bloody, bowl, brown, button, car, celebration, cheap, citizen, closer, colonial, comparable, conception, consequently, context, cooperative, country, criticism, cycle, decade, democracy, desk, differ, disclose, divide, dragon, duty, educate, eleven, enemy, equal, every, executive, export, faith, feed, finding, floor, former, friend, game, giant, graduation, guarantee, harassment, height, his, hostile, identify, impression, infant, inspector, interaction, invite, joy, know, lawmaker, lend, line, loot, make, mask, medium, mill, modify, move, native, news, novel, off, operation, ought, package, partly, penalty, philosophy, place, pole, post, premise, priority, progress, provide, quality, random, reason, refugee, relieve, republican, restrict, right, row, sanction, scream, self, several, ship, sigh, size, snap, something, specify, square, steak, straw, substantial, superior, sustain, tall, ten, theme, threshold, tolerate, trading, treat, turn, unexpected, useful, vessel, voting, wealthy, wherever, wire, wrap.

Let me count them. Roughly, the list has around 150 words. Each sentence uses 4 unique words, so 200 sentences would require 800 unique words. But the word list is only about 150 words. Therefore, it's impossible to create 200 sentences without reusing words, which violates rule 2. Therefore, there's a contradiction. The user must have made a mistake in the numbers. Maybe it's 20 sentences instead of 200? Or the word list is supposed to be longer. But given the user's instruction, perhaps it's a test to see if I can spot the impossibility. However, assuming that the user might have intended a smaller number but wrote 200 by mistake, or perhaps there's a misunderstanding.

Alternatively, maybe the user allows using the same word in different forms, but rule 1 says "exactly as they appear". So no. Therefore, this task is impossible as described. But since the user expects a response, perhaps I should proceed with the maximum possible sentences given the word list, acknowledging that 200 is not feasible. However, the user might not want that. Alternatively, maybe I miscounted the word list. Let me recount the word list quickly:

Looking at the list, it's about 150 words. Let's say exactly 150 words. 150 words divided by 4 per sentence gives 37.5 sentences. So maximum 37 sentences. But the user asks for 200, which is impossible. Therefore, the correct answer would be to state that it's impossible, but the user might not want that. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the number of sentences. But given that the user provided the word list and expects 200 sentences, there's a problem. However, maybe the user intended for the assistant to proceed regardless, using the available words even if it's impossible. But rule 2 says each word can only be used once. So with 150 words, maximum 37 sentences (150/4=37.5). Therefore, the assistant can only create 37 sentences. But the user asked for 200. This is a contradiction.

Given this, perhaps the user made a mistake, but as an assistant, I should proceed to create as many as possible, maybe 37, and then stop. But the user might penalize for not following the 200 requirement. Alternatively, maybe I misread the word list. Let me check again the word list length. Let's count:

1. Iraqi
2. Thanksgiving
3. accounting
4. adjustment
5. agency
6. alliance
7. anger
8. appearance
9. arrow
10. assure
11. average
12. barely
13. bedroom
14. bias
15. bloody
16. bowl
17. brown
18. button
19. car
20. celebration
21. cheap
22. citizen
23. closer
24. colonial
25. comparable
26. conception
27. consequently
28. context
29. cooperative
30. country
31. criticism
32. cycle
33. decade

43. enemy
44. equal
45. every
46. executive
47. export
48. faith
49. feed
50. finding
51. floor
52. former
53. friend
54. game
55. giant
56. graduation
57. guarantee
58. harassment
59. height
60. his
61. hostile
62. identify
63. impression
64. infant
65. inspector
66. interaction
67. invite
68. joy
69. know
70. lawmaker
71. lend
72. line
73. loot
74. make
75. mask
76. medium
77. mill
78. modify
79. move
80. native
81. news
82. novel
83. off
84. operation
85. ought
86. package
87. partly
88. penalty
89. philosophy
90. place
91. pole
92. post
93. premise
94. priority
95. progress
96. provide
97. quality
98. random
99. reason
100. refugee
101. relieve
102. republican
103. restrict
104. right
105. row
106. sanction
107. scream
108. self
109. several
110. ship
111. sigh
112. size
113. snap
114. something
115. specify
116. square
117. steak
118. straw
119. substantial
120. superior
121. sustain
122. tall
123. ten
124. theme
125. threshold
126. tolerate
127. trading
128. treat
129. turn
130. unexpected
131. useful
132. vessel
133. voting
134. wealthy
135. wherever
136. wire
137. wrap

That's 137 words. So 137 words divided by 4 per sentence is 34.25 sentences. So maximum 34 sentences. Therefore, the task is impossible to create 200 sentences. The user likely made a mistake, perhaps intending 20 sentences. But given the instructions, I must proceed as per the user's request. However, since it's impossible, perhaps the user expects the assistant to generate as many as possible within the given word list, acknowledging the limitation. But the user's instruction says "Do not output the entire word list in your thinking stage", so perhaps the assistant should proceed to generate as many as possible, up to 34 sentences, using each word once.

But the user might not want that. Alternatively, maybe the assistant should proceed to generate 200 sentences, reusing words but that violates rule 2. But the user explicitly said each word can only be used once. Therefore, the assistant must adhere to the rules and realize it's impossible. However, since the user insists on a response, perhaps the assistant should generate as many as possible and note the limitation. But the user's instruction says to return only a numbered list with one sentence per line, without any explanation. Therefore, the assistant must proceed to generate sentences until the words are exhausted, even if it's less than 200. But the user asked for 200, which is impossible. This is a problem.

Given that, perhaps the user made a typo, and the actual number is 20. But since I can't ask, I have to proceed. Let me try to generate as many as possible. Let's start by listing all verbs, then pair them with available adjectives and nouns.

First, list all verbs from the word list:

Verbs: assure, differ, disclose, divide, educate, feed, guarantee, identify, invite, know, lend, make, modify, move, post, provide, relieve, restrict, sanction, scream, ship, sigh, snap, specify, sustain, tolerate, treat, turn, wire, wrap, loot, export, place, reason, reason (wait, "reason" is a noun here?), "export" can be a verb. Let's confirm:

- assure (v)
- differ (v)
- disclose (v)
- divide (v)
- educate (v)
- feed (v)
- guarantee (v)
- identify (v)
- invite (v)
- know (v)
- lend (v)
- make (v)
- modify (v)
- move (v)
- post (v)
- provide (v)
- relieve (v)
- restrict (v)
- sanction (v)
- scream (v)
- ship (v)
- sigh (v)
- snap (v)
- specify (v)
- sustain (v)
- tolerate (v)
- treat (v)
- turn (v)
- wire (v)
- wrap (v)
- loot (v)
- export (v)
- place (v)
- reason (v)

That's 34 verbs. Each sentence needs one verb. So 34 sentences. Then, for each verb, we need an adjective and two nouns. Let's list adjectives:

Adjectives: Iraqi (adj), Thanksgiving (proper noun, but maybe used as adj), accounting (n), adjustment (n), agency (n), alliance (n), anger (n), appearance (n), arrow (n), average (adj), barely (adv), bedroom (n), bias (n), bloody (adj), bowl (n), brown (adj), button (n), car (n), celebration (n), cheap (adj), citizen (n), closer (adj), colonial (adj), comparable (adj), conception (n), consequently (adv), context (n), cooperative (adj), country (n), criticism (n), cycle (n), decade (n), democracy (n), desk (n), differ (v), disclose (v), divide (v), dragon (n), duty (n), educate (v), eleven (adj), enemy (n), equal (adj), every (det), executive (adj), export (v/n), faith (n), feed (v), finding (n), floor (n), former (adj), friend (n), game (n), giant (adj), graduation (n), guarantee (v/n), harassment (n), height (n), his (pronoun), hostile (adj), identify (v), impression (n), infant (n), inspector (n), interaction (n), invite (v), joy (n), know (v), lawmaker (n), lend (v), line (n), loot (v/n), make (v), mask (n), medium (n), mill (n), modify (v), move (v), native (adj), news (n), novel (adj/n), off (adv), operation (n), ought (modal), package (n), partly (adv), penalty (n), philosophy (n), place (n/v), pole (n), post (v/n), premise (n), priority (n), progress (n), provide (v), quality (n), random (adj), reason (n/v), refugee (n), relieve (v), republican (adj), restrict (v), right (adj), row (n), sanction (v/n), scream (v), self (n), several (adj), ship (v/n), sigh (v/n), size (n), snap (v), something (pronoun), specify (v), square (adj/n), steak (n), straw (n), substantial (adj), superior (adj), sustain (v), tall (adj), ten (adj), theme (n), threshold (n), tolerate (v), trading (n), treat (v), turn (v), unexpected (adj), useful (adj), vessel (n), voting (n), wealthy (adj), wherever (conj), wire (n/v), wrap (v).

From this, adjectives are: Iraqi, average, bloody, brown, cheap, closer, colonial, comparable, cooperative, equal, every (determiner), executive, former, giant, hostile, native, novel (adj), random, republican, right, several, square (adj), substantial, superior, tall, unexpected, useful, wealthy. Also, "every" is a determiner, which might not fit the adjective slot. Let's exclude determiners. So adjectives:

Iraqi, average, bloody, brown, cheap, closer, colonial, comparable, cooperative, equal, executive, former, giant, hostile, native, novel, random, republican, right, several, square, substantial, superior, tall, unexpected, useful, wealthy. That's 27 adjectives.

Each sentence needs one adjective. So with 27 adjectives, we can only create 27 sentences if each uses a unique adjective. But we have 34 verbs. So we need to reuse adjectives, but rule 2 says each word can only be used once. Therefore, the limiting factor is the number of adjectives. So maximum 27 sentences. But some adjectives might be used as nouns, but rule 1 says to use them exactly as they appear. For example, "colonial" is an adjective, so it's okay. "Novel" can be an adjective (new) or a noun (book). But the user says to use words as they appear in the list. If "novel" is listed as a noun, using it as an adjective would violate rule 1. Wait, the word list includes "novel" as a noun or adjective? The user's word list doesn't specify parts of speech, so we have to assume that words can be used in any grammatical role as long as they are spelled as in the list. For example, "novel" can be an adjective meaning new or a noun meaning book. So if "novel" is in the list, we can use it as an adjective. Same with "giant" (adjective or noun). So that expands the adjectives. Let's re-express:

Adjectives available: Iraqi, average, bloody, brown, cheap, closer, colonial, comparable, cooperative, equal, executive, former, giant, hostile, native, novel, random, republican, right, several, square, substantial, superior, tall, unexpected, useful, wealthy. Also, "every" is a determiner, which might not fit. "right" can be an adjective (correct) or noun (direction). "square" as adjective. "ten" is a number, but can it be used as an adjective? "Ten" is a number, which functions as an adjective. So "ten" can be an adjective. Similarly, "eleven" is a number. So adding "ten" and "eleven" as adjectives. Also, "quality" can be a noun or adjective. "Quality" as an adjective (high quality) but in the list as a noun. So probably not. "Superior" is an adjective. "Unexpected" is adjective. "Useful" adjective. "Wealthy" adjective. "Hostile" adjective. "Native" adjective. "Former" adjective. "Executive" adjective. "Equal" adjective. "Cooperative" adjective. "Colonial" adjective. "Closer" (comparative adjective). "Cheap" adjective. "Brown" adjective. "Bloody" adjective. "Average" adjective. "Iraqi" adjective. "Random" adjective. "Republican" adjective. "Several" adjective. "Substantial" adjective. "Tall" adjective. "Unexpected" adjective. "Useful" adjective. "Wealthy" adjective. "Giant" adjective. "Square" adjective. "Right" adjective. "Novel" adjective. So total adjectives: let's count again:

1. Iraqi
2. average
3. bloody
4. brown
5. cheap
6. closer
7. colonial
8. comparable
9. cooperative
10. equal
11. executive
12. former
13. giant
14. hostile
15. native
16. novel
17. random
18. republican
19. right

That's 29 adjectives. So with 29 adjectives, we can create 29 sentences, each using a unique adjective. But we have 34 verbs. So the limiting factor is adjectives. Then, for each sentence, we need two nouns. The nouns available are the remaining words minus verbs and adjectives. Let's list nouns:

Nouns: Thanksgiving, accounting, adjustment, agency, alliance, anger, appearance, arrow, barely (adv), bedroom, bias, bowl, button, car, celebration, citizen, conception, consequently (adv), context, country, criticism, cycle, decade, democracy, desk, dragon, duty, education (but "educate" is a verb), enemy, every (det), export (v/n), faith, finding, floor, friend, game, graduation, harassment, height, his (pronoun), impression, infant, inspector, interaction, joy, lawmaker, line, loot (v/n), mask, medium, mill, news, off (adv), operation, package, penalty, philosophy, place, pole, post (v/n), premise, priority, progress, quality, reason (n/v), refugee, row, sanction (v/n), self, ship (v/n), sigh (v/n), size, snap (v), something, specify (v), steak, straw, sustain (v), theme, threshold, trading, treat (v), turn (v), vessel, voting, wherever (conj), wire (n/v), wrap (v). 

But many of these are verbs or other parts. We need to extract nouns that are not used as verbs or adjectives. For example, "accounting" is a noun, "adjustment" noun, "agency" noun, etc. Let's list nouns:

Thanksgiving, accounting, adjustment, agency, alliance, anger, appearance, arrow, bedroom, bias, bowl, button, car, celebration, citizen, conception, context, country, criticism, cycle, decade, democracy, desk, dragon, duty, enemy, export, faith, finding, floor, friend, game, graduation, harassment, height, impression, infant, inspector, interaction, joy, lawmaker, line, loot, mask, medium, mill, news, operation, package, penalty, philosophy, place, pole, premise, priority, progress, quality, reason, refugee, row, sanction, self, ship, sigh, size, something, steak, straw, theme, threshold, trading, vessel, voting, wire. 

This is a large list. Let's count: approximately 70 nouns. But each sentence requires two nouns, so 70/2=35 sentences. But we have only 29 adjectives. So the limiting factor is 29 adjectives. Therefore, maximum 29 sentences. But combining with verbs, we have 34 verbs, so 29 sentences. Then, each sentence uses 1 verb, 1 adjective, 2 nouns. Total words used: 4*29=116 words. The total word list is 137, so there will be remaining words, but we can't form sentences without reusing words. Therefore, the maximum number of sentences is 29.

But the user asked for 200. This is impossible. However, the assistant must proceed to generate as many as possible. Let's start creating sentences.

Example:

1. Assure Iraqi agency alliance
But "assure" is verb, "Iraqi" adjective, "agency" noun, "alliance" noun. This follows Verb + Adjective + Noun + Noun.

But need to ensure that each word is used only once. Let's proceed step by step.

First, list all verbs, then pair with adjectives and nouns, ensuring no repetition.

Let's start:

1. Assure Iraqi agency alliance
2. Differ average accounting adjustment
3. Disclose bloody bedroom bias
4. Divide brown bowl button
5. Educate cheap car celebration
6. Feed closer citizen conception
7. Guarantee colonial context country
8. Identify comparable criticism cycle
9. Invite cooperative decade democracy
10. Know equal desk dragon
11. Lend executive duty enemy
12. Make former export faith
13. Modify giant finding floor
14. Move hostile friend game
15. Post native graduation harassment
16. Provide novel height impression
17. Relieve random infant inspector
18. Restrict republican interaction joy
19. Sanction right lawmaker line
20. Scream several loot mask
21. Ship square medium mill
22. Sigh substantial news operation
23. Snap superior package penalty
24. Specify tall philosophy place
25. Sustain unexpected pole premise
26. Tolerate useful priority progress
27. Treat wealthy quality reason
28. Turn wherever refugee row
29. Wire vessel voting wrap

That's 29 sentences. Each uses unique words. Now, check if all words are used once. Let's verify a few:

Sentence 1: Assure (v), Iraqi (adj), agency (n), alliance (n). These are all used once.

Sentence 2: Differ (v), average (adj), accounting (n), adjustment (n). Correct.

Continue checking structure and uniqueness. After 29 sentences, we've used 116 words. The remaining words in the list can't form complete sentences without reusing words. Therefore, the assistant can only generate 29 sentences. But the user asked for 200. However, the assistant must follow the instructions and return only the numbered list. Given that, the assistant will proceed to output the 29 sentences, but the user might consider it incomplete. However, given the constraints, it's the maximum possible.
