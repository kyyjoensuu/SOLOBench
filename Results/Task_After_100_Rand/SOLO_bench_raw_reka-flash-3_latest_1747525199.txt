Example Sentences:
1. Relieve equal duty bowl.
2. Scream anger joy scream.

Your task is to be meticulous to ensure that all rules are
'''

reason = '''
Thinking through this task, I need to create 200 sentences with four words each, using the provided word list without repetition and following the structure Verb + Adjective + Noun + Noun. Let me start by understanding the requirements thoroughly.

First, each sentence must conform to Verb + Adjective + Noun + Noun. So I need to find verbs that can be followed by adjectives and then two nouns. Each word can only be used once, so I have to manage the list carefully as I go along.

Looking at the example sentences: "Relieve equal duty bowl." and "Scream anger joy scream.". The first example uses a verb "Relieve", adjective "equal", noun "duty", then another noun "bowl". The second has a verb repeated, but since the word list might have unique instances, I need to check if words are allowed to repeat. Wait, rule 2 says each word can only be used once. So in the second example, "scream" is used twice, which would actually be invalid. But wait, maybe that's an error in the example? Or perhaps the example isn't perfect, and I should follow the rules strictly.

So no repetition of any word once it's used. Therefore, each sentence must use four unique words not used elsewhere.

Now, starting with the first word list provided. Let me try to categorize the verbs and adjectives so I can pair them appropriately.

Looking at the verbs: Relieve, Scream, Make, Feed, Lend, Snap, Borrow (wait, "borrow" isn't in the list. Wait the words are: decade, straw, line, equal, infant, duty, hostile, wire, relieve, eleven, refugee, square, superior, guarantee, bias, comparable, cooperative, turn, size, harassment, native, friend, ten, joy, specify, self, unexpected, identify, novel, philosophy, graduation, bedroom, anger, place, enemy, bowl, scream, Thanksgiving, former, arrow, lawmaker, tolerate, package, progress, sustain, giant, celebration, executive, restrict, right, useful, off, vessel, height, ship, operation, appearance, colonial, Iraqi, penalty, wherever, cycle, agency, interaction, loot, desk, threshold, car, wrap, partly, accounting, brown, country, democracy, premise, modify, game, closer, tall, quality, button, dragon, row, barely, differ, finding, consequently, make, feed, theme, snap, lend, bloody, faith, ought, substantial, something, alliance, floor, citizen, educate, assure, average, know, trading, wealthy, priority, adjustment, steak, disclose, inspector, invite, move, republican, divide, conception, news, sigh, mill, provide, export, pole, random, cheap, voting, several, mask, context, every, sanction, medium, his, criticism, reason, treat, post.

Verbs in the list: relieve, scream, make, feed, snap, lend, identify, graduate (wait, graduation is a noun), execute (executive is a noun), restrict, sustain, operate (operation is a noun), modify, provide, export, disclose, invite, move. Hmm, some of these are nouns or adjectives but can also be verbs. For example, "provide" is a verb here. Need to check which words are verbs.

Alternatively, the user provided the word list as exact words, so I need to see which ones can function as verbs in the structure Verb + Adjective + Noun + Noun.

Looking at possible verbs: relieve, scream, make, feed, snap, lend, identify, graduate (maybe), execute (but executive is a noun), restrict, sustain, operate (from operation), modify, provide, export, disclose, invite, move. Others like "turn" could be a verb, but "turn" might require an object. For example, "Turn hostile line arrow." But does that make sense? Maybe not.

Adjectives in the list: equal, superior, cooperative, hostile, hostile again, brown, tall, quality, useful, off, part (from partly?), cheap, substantial, something, closer, bare, different (differ is a verb), critical (criticism is noun), average, wealthy, priority, adjustment (noun), Bloody (capitalized?), faithful (faith is a noun), ought, every, several, random, medium-sized? Probably not. So adjectives are words that describe nouns, like equal, superior, hostile, cooperative, brown, tall, useful, etc.

Nouns: decade, straw, line, infant, duty, wire, bowl, Thanksgiving, arrow, lawmaker, package, ship, operation, appearance, car, desk, threshold, button, dragon, row, country, citizen, graduate (from graduation), bedroom, enemy, joy, theme, steak, inspector, vote, medium, his, reason, treat, post, etc.

Now, I need to create sentences by combining a verb, then an adjective, then two nouns. Each word must be unique and used only once.

Let me start creating sentences one by one, keeping track of used words. Let's begin:

1. Relieve equal duty bowl. (Used: relieve, equal, duty, bowl)
2. Scream anger joy scream. Wait, but "scream" is repeated here. That's invalid. So need to adjust. Maybe "Scream angry joy peace." But "angry" isn't in the list. Available adjectives: hostility? No, hostile is there. Hostile is an adjective. So perhaps "Scream hostile joy scream"? Doesn't make sense. Alternatively, find another verb and adjective. Let's try next.

3. Make equal infant duty. (make, equal, infant, duty)
4. Feed superior bowl straw. (feed, superior, bowl, straw)
5. Snap hostile wire line. (snap, hostile, wire, line)
6. Lend cooperative bowl package. (lend, cooperative, bowl, package)
7. Identify tall enemy joy. (identify, tall, enemy, joy)
8. Sustain brown country operation. (sustain, brown, country, operation)
9. Provide useful ship package. (provide, useful, ship, package)
10. Export cheap medium car. (export, cheap, medium, car)
11. Disclose substantial reason criticism. (disclose, substantial, reason, criticism)
12. Invite priority guest alliance. Wait, "guest" isn't in the list. Maybe "Invite priority citizen country." (invite, priority, citizen, country)
13. Move hostile law enforcement. But "enforcement" isn't in the list. Perhaps "Move hostile lawmaker arrow." (move, hostile, lawmaker, arrow)
14. Restrict average trade duty. (restrict, average, trade, duty) but "trade" not in list. Maybe "Restrict average truck car." (truck not listed; available nouns: ship, car, etc.) So "Restrict average ship vessel." (restrict, average, ship, vessel)
15. Modify tall desk height. (modify, tall, desk, height)
16. Graduate brown bedroom education. But "education" not in list. Maybe "Graduate brown bed room." Not quite. Alternatively, "Graduate brown country alliance." (graduate, brown, country, alliance)
17. Operate superior car ship. (operate, superior, car, ship)
18. Borrow substantial joy reason. Wait, "borrow" isn't a verb here; need to use a different verb. Maybe "Sustain substantial joy reason." (sustain is already used in sentence 8.) So pick another verb: "Provide substantial joy reason." (provide is used) Hmm, tricky. Let's try a new approach.

Continuing this process would take time, but I need to ensure each sentence follows the structure and uses unique words. Since it's 200 sentences, this will require careful tracking. After some iterations, here’s a possible list:

1. Relieve equal duty bowl.
2. Scream anger joy scream. (Invalid due to repetition)
3. Make equal infant duty.
4. Feed superior bowl straw.
5. Snap hostile wire line.
6. Lend cooperative bowl package.
7. Identify tall enemy joy.
8. Sustain brown country operation.
9. Provide useful ship package.
10. Export cheap medium car.
11. Disclose substantial reason criticism.
12. Invite priority citizen country.
13. Move hostile lawmaker arrow.
14. Restrict average trade duty. (adjust "trade" to "vessel")
15. Modify tall desk height.
16. Graduate brown bed room. (adjust to valid nouns)
17. Operate superior car ship.
18. Sustain substantial joy reason. (sustain used, try another verb: "Provide substantial joy reason." but provide used)
19. Disclose tall joy conflict. (disclose used)
20. Snap average wire line. (snap used)
21. Make hostile law package. (make used)
22. Feed superior car operation. (feed used)
23. Identify brown enemy country.
24. Sustain useful ship vessel. (sustain used)
25. Provide equal duty bowl. (provide used)
26. Export cheap medium car. (export used)
27. Disclose substantial reason criticism. (disclose used)
28. Invite priority citizen country. (invite used)
29. Move hostile lawmaker arrow. (move used)
30. Restrict average vessel ship. (restrict used)

This is getting repetitive, and I haven't even reached 30 yet. It's clear that maintaining unique words while forming valid sentences is challenging. I need to systematically go through each word in the list and assign them appropriately.

Another approach: categorize verbs, adjectives, and nouns, then pair them without overlap.

Verbs available (from the list): relieve, scream, make, feed, snap, lend, identify, graduate, sustain, provide, export, disclose, invite, move, restrict, modify, operate.

Adjectives: equal, superior, cooperative, hostile, brown, tall, useful, off, cheap, substantial, something, closer, bare, different (differ is a verb), critical (criticism noun), average, wealthy, priority, adjustment, bloody, faithful (faith noun), ought, every, several, random, medium.

Nouns: decade, straw, line, infant, duty, wire, bowl, Thanksgiving, arrow, lawmaker, package, progress, sustain, giant, celebration, executive, restrict, right, useful, off, vessel, height, ship, operation, appearance, colonial, Iraqi, penalty, wherever, cycle, agency, interaction, loot, desk, threshold, car, wrap, partly, accounting, brown, country, democracy, premise, modify, game, closer, tall, quality, button, dragon, row, barely, differ, finding, consequently, make, feed, theme, snap, lend, bloody, faith, ought, substantial, something, alliance, floor, citizen, educate, assure, average, know, trading, wealthy, priority, adjustment, steak, disclose, inspector, invite, move, republican, divide, conception, news, sigh, mill, provide, export, pole, random, cheap, voting, several, mask, context, every, sanction, medium, his, criticism, reason, treat, post.

This is quite extensive. To create 200 sentences, each word must be used exactly once. Given the constraint, I need to ensure that after using a word in one sentence, it's not reused.

Let's start constructing sentences methodically:

1. Relieve equal duty bowl.
2. Scream hostile joy scream. (Invalid repetition)
   → Correct: Scream hostile joy peace. (But "peace" isn't in the list. Use available nouns: Perhaps "Scream hostile Joy Friday." but Friday not listed. Alternative: "Scream hostile Joy arrow." (scream, hostile, joy, arrow))
3. Make equal infant duty.
4. Feed superior bowl straw.
5. Snap hostile wire line.
6. Lend cooperative bowl package.
7. Identify tall enemy joy.
8. Sustain brown country operation.
9. Provide useful ship package.
10. Export cheap medium car.
11. Disclose substantial reason criticism.
12. Invite priority citizen country.
13. Move hostile lawmaker arrow.
14. Restrict average vessel ship.
15. Modify tall desk height.
16. Graduate brown bed room. (Adjust to "Graduate brown bedroom door." but "door" not in list. Maybe "Graduate brown classroom nation.") (graduate, brown, classroom, nation)
17. Operate superior car ship.
18. Sustain substantial joy reason. (sustain used; use another verb: "Provide substantial joy reason." (provide used) → "Disclose substantial joy reason." (disclose used) → "Invite substantial joy reason." (invite used) → Maybe "Modify substantial joy reason." (modify, substantial, joy, reason)
19. Snap average wire line. (snap used)
20. Make hostile law package. (make used)
21. Feed superior car operation. (feed used)
22. Identify brown enemy country.
23. Sustain useful ship vessel. (sustain used)
24. Provide equal duty bowl. (provide used)
25. Export cheap medium car. (export used)
26. Disclose substantial reason criticism. (disclose used)
27. Invite priority citizen country. (invite used)
28. Move hostile lawmaker arrow. (move used)
29. Restrict average vessel ship. (restrict used)
30. Modify tall desk height. (modify used)

This process is tedious, but I need to continue until 200 sentences. Each time, selecting a verb, then an adjective, then two nouns that haven't been used yet. Ensuring the sentence structure and meaning are somewhat logical, though they don't have to be perfect as long as they follow the grammar rules.

Continuing in this manner, keeping track of each used word across all sentences is crucial. Since manually doing this for 200 entries is error-prone, I must be thorough to avoid repetitions. It's a challenging task but manageable with systematic categorization and cross-referencing each word's usage.
