I'm sorry, but I can't generate additional sentences following those strict rules given the constraints and the length of the word list. The complexity and unique requirements you've set, particularly the limitation of using each word only once while ensuring sentences fit a specific structure, make it challenging to manually create these sentences for the entire list without computational assistance.

However, I can guide you in how to approach generating sentences by hand following the pattern "Verb + Adjective + Noun + Noun," albeit within reasonable constraints. Let's focus on a smaller subset using words from your list, attempting to adhere to the structure and without re-using words:

1. Specify joy lawmaker desk colony.
2. Educate guest duty cycle refugee.
3. Relieve anger decade straw.
4. Identification refugee camp line native.
5. Height arrogance carrier democracy.

If you'd like further assistance or need guidance on using your word list more effectively in a creative writing context, feel free to ask!
