You are working for an engineering company that needs a system which automatically generates code for a project with very specific rules:
- A given Python script contains two functions: func0 and func1
- func0 contains code that takes no input and always returns 2.
- func1 takes as input one number.
- Your goal is to write the following Python script (and return it in the format listed below) but it needs to use the given `func0` and `func1` from the given Python script

You need to complete the given Python script by adding the following codes:
1. Make the code `func1` only return the average of 3 numbers if the first number is even and greater than 3. If the first number is not even or is less than 3, make `func1` return the given function 3 + 1, and the given function 3 + 1 + 3.
2. Make the average returned from `func1` return the mean of all of numbers that return an even number and return the max of the numbers that return an odd number.
3. In the main script return and average the calls to `func1` and `func0`.
4. Make sure the final return is always greater than 90 and make sure a random variable has to multiply with the output 
5. Do not use any code from this task other than `func0` and `func1`

# Exercise 3 - Random variables to control a script

Here is a script that generates four random variables. You must insert random
variables into the script in the four places where you need to insert one. The
variables should be from 1 to 7, but should be assigned to the variable x, y, z and p,
for example. Once you're done, run the script and make sure that you can change the
number of times the script is run by changing the value of one of the random variables.

```
1. Generate four random variables, each variable should be from 1 to 7.
2. Assign each of the variables to a variable name.
3. Insert all four variables into the script.
4. Ensure that the random variables can be altered by setting them to 1 or 2 etc.
5. Make the script run the first three times and stop when it doesn't work.
- Run the script and run it again. If you get a random number, try a different order. If you get a 0, try a different random number.
- Make sure the script runs three times and stop when it doesn't work.
6. Once the first three variables are in their random locations, try to set a new random variable to 1.
7. The script now has four random variables and they are all being used. Run it a few times then try new random variables.
8. Try adding a new random variable and try setting the values of the new random variables to the previous values.
9. Try a new random variable which has a specific meaning.
```

Example:

```
The first random variable should be set to 1 if the script runs 3 times.
```
```
I am not sure which is the best thing to do with my numbers. How do I control the
number of times the script runs?
```
```
The second random variable should be set to 2 if the script runs 3 times.
```
```
If the script runs 3 times, the 4th random variable should be set to 4.
```
```
Run the script and try different combinations of the random variables until the
script runs 3 times.
```
```
Make some changes to see how different random variables make the script run.
- Add a new random variable.
- Change the random variable.
- Set different random variables to specific values.
- Try a random variable which is a multiple of 10.

15. Set the random variables to a sequence that is a multiple of 10.
16. Set the new random variable to 1 if the script runs 3 times, 2 if it runs 3 times or
3.
17. Set random variables to the sequences of the first 3 scripts.
- Set random variables to the sequences of the first 3 scripts.
18. Add more script lines to set random variables and make sure the script runs 3 times
and stop at the end of the script.
19. Try setting a different sequence of random variables to control the number of times
the script runs.
- Try setting a new random variable to control the number of times the script runs.
20. Make sure the script runs three times then run it again and make sure it stops.
21. Make sure the script runs three times and make sure the script runs three times
then stop when it doesn's.
- Try setting a new random variable to control the number of times the script runs.
22. Try setting the output of the script to 01-04 and make sure it runs 4 times.
23. Try setting the output of the script to 5.
24. Run the script and make sure it works.
25. Make sure the output of the script is a random number.
26. Try setting the output of the script to 04 or 03.
- Make sure the output is a random number 87.
27. Try setting new outputs of the script to 9.
28. Make the output of the script is a random number 87.```

Use random numbers to control the number of times the script runs. Make random numbers be the sum of two random numbers. Make a random number be used as a random number. Assign the output of the program to a new random number. Create the program output as an integer. Create a function which can be used to control the number of times the script runs. Try a random number as an output of the function. Create the function output as an integer. Try a random variable as an output of the function. Add the function output to the random number. Create a function which is the sum of two random numbers. Generate a sequence of random variables. Generate a series of random variables. Create a program that uses a function. Try a new function which is used. Use random variables as outputs of a function. Try a sequence of random variables. Make a sequence of random variables be used. Generate a sequence of random variables. Create a function which is used to control the number of times the script runs. Generate a series of random variables.

# Exercise 28 - Random variables with input from a sequence of numbers

Here comes a program that tries to use random numbers to do a script. How can these
random variables affect the program? Try to insert variables in the following way:
```
1. Generate an input. Use the input to write the script. Generate an output. Try to write the script. Generate an output. Try to write the script. Generate an output. Use the input to write the script. Generate an output. Use the input to write the script. Try to write the script. Generate an output. Generate an input. Try to write the script. Generate an output. Try to write the script. Generate an output. Try to write the script. Try to write the script. Generate an output. Try to write the script. Generate an output. Try to write the script. Generate an output. Try to write the script. Try to write the script. Generate an output. Try to write the script. Generate an output. Try to write the script. Generate an output. Generate an input. Try to write the script. Try to write the script. Generate an output. Try to write the script. Generate an output. Try to write the script. Generate an output. Try to write the script. Generate an output. Try to write the script. Generate an output.
```

Example:

```
1. Generate an input for the program to write the script. How will the program write
the script when the program does random numbers?
