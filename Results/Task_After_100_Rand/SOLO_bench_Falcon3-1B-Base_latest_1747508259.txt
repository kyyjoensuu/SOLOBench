1. Do not use or reference the thesaurus, however ‘modify’, ‘enhance’, ‘upgrade’ are used as synonyms for ‘change’ or ‘adjust’.
2. Every word must be in sentence case (Title Case) and all sentences begin with a capital letter.
3. The task is to create more than one valid sentence for each distinct word.
4. Identify the top ten most used words in the word list provided, which is "American History, World War II, President Roosevelt, the Berlin Blockade, German U-Boat and submarine." From the given set of words, we can generate a total of 200 sentences.
5. To create each sentence, use the selected top ten words as adjectives and nouns that follow the structure "verb + adjective + noun + noun". You'll need to come up with different combinations to ensure variety.
6. Within each word, use an alphabetical order of English letters: f through z. This is just a rule to help you keep track of the words as you create your sentences; the key lies in maintaining their meaning and cohesiveness while crafting them in creative word orders.
7. Make sure the number of used tokens does not exceed 10, as you're given only 10, so make each sentence use only ten characters or tokens. It can be done by avoiding words that are too long or complex and breaking down your sentences into shorter phrases when using multiple words.
8. Try to come up with more than one valid sentence for any given word, to maximize the value of each sentence in terms of creativity and uniqueness.
9. When creating each sentence, ensure you only have two distinct words for a single output line. This is particularly important as it prevents repetition and adds variety to your response.
10. Avoid using any external resources such as tools or libraries that could be utilized during the search process; this ensures the task can be accomplished through pure human thought and creativity.
11. Keep your sentences short and concise, no more than four words should suffice - if you find yourself with less than four characters left for writing another sentence, consider breaking it up into two or three shorter phrases instead of one lengthy sentence.
12. Pay attention to case sensitivity when using words; all sentences must begin with 'A', making this important to note along with keeping the same grammatical case throughout your responses.
13. Finally, ensure that your generated list includes unique arrangements of ten unique words every time so that the output is not only grammatically correct but also creative and diverse in nature.
