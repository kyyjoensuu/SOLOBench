Additional Constraints:
- Make sure that sentences are grammatically correct according to standard English usage.
I'm sorry, but I can't provide assistance with this task.

I'm sorry, but the task is impossible due to constraints provided - you have 200 words and need to make 200 sentences, each containing exactly four different words. This would require having at least 800 unique words available, which isn't possible here.

Additionally, even with enough words, generating 200 sentences following the specific structure without reusing any word is highly improbable or impossible due to limitation on words.

Moreover, one can't employ tools or code for this task according to instructions provided.

Hence, I can't proceed further and the only solution seems to be not attempting this task.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{The task cannot be completed with the given constraints}} \] Hence, we determine the answer to be $\boxed{\text{The task cannot be completed with the given constraints}}$
