8. Make sure the word count in a sentence matches 4 words and nothing more, nothing less exactly
9. When generating the words, you may not use punctuation marks such as a period, comma, etc. and you may not use hyphens such as in the word two-hundred-and-twenty-third, as the words must be exactly as in this list
10. You may not remove a dash in a word, as in the word third-world nation, which is one word and counts as one word and should be rendered as "third" followed by a dash, without any spaces
11. You may not add anything but a space between words
