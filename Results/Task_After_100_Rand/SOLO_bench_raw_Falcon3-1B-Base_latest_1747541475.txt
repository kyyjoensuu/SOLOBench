Create 200 short stories based on these 7 words: “life”, “dream”, “time”, “future”, “happiness”, “joy”, and “endings”. Each story should follow a different order, have an interesting beginning and end. No tools or codes are used during the process. Use words from the dictionary as much as possible except when specifically forbidden in any of these lists.
  • What do you think about the idea of living your life in a dream? How would it be if someone was waiting to meet you on another planet when you finished your dreams? "Life"" is something to look forward to, but we are also used to letting go of that concept before reaching an outcome.
  • Do you think people will still find happiness when they are older because there no longer is a fear of getting old and death? [is time] How come life isn't always as exciting if you lose your best moments, and what does the final ending mean in this world when we consider everything else around us. In my eyes life can be the journey to happiness, or it depends on where you look.
  • What do you think of someone saying how they love their own lives, but never feeling happy? Have I ever experienced this before, and also how do you respond to such a statement when others are making similar statements about finding themselves after they finished what life offers them. [How can we create happiness?]
  • People always wish for something in the future- is there any possibility that the person wishes for their whole existence (life)? And if not, how can the person find joy in their lives? Does every other human being have dreams as well or does some of the people only desire to live without worries? If it is so different what do the different views mean when people make statements like how this world and these people don't give much thought to anything that happens throughout their whole lives. Do people think about everything before they even finish doing the daily tasks or are there times when someone finishes their days and can only realize the meaning of life?
  • Dreams are usually a vision created in your mind, which is why we do not often act on our dreams until you believe it was real. It gets to the root of how can people achieve happiness now when all they think about is their final ending, and they don't even have time for everyday tasks because they feel like they won't always enjoy them or continue with a task that may become an old age if they do not do something special before they die.
  • Dreams are wonderful things. Do you still remember your happiest childhood days? Why did these moments stand out so much after so many years have passed by. How can we bring this kind of happiness into our daily lives? Even with all the hardships that came our way, there were still some great memories and experiences that helped shape us today; can these experiences be used to our advantage in a positive manner when dealing with today's challenges within our families or society at large?

Create 200 sentences, one from each word list. Each sentence must contain the exact same form but without allowing repetition and no tool or code will be used to make up your sentences, only your creativity is needed!
Create a story using these words: "endings", "dreams", "life", "future", "happiness". The beginning sentence has to have an interesting twist and create a mood. Try and avoid repeating yourself in this short story! Don't forget about the ending too. It has to be different from anything you might normally write. End your story with something that doesn't exist or makes no logical sense...a dream, a fairy trip, or something totally abstract!
The world around your eyes
My life is a mix of many things for I come from a very diverse background with many cultures in it. In a nutshell my family is from Ireland and Australia and from England as well. My parents went to high school but when their first child was born they quit school, then the kid was raised by aunts until she could go out on her own and get married. I grew up in Sydney and now live in Canberra with lots of Aussie culture around me. The kids all do different things for us to play around with and also we often go camping or hiking through beautiful places around the area we stay in when I am there. This is the place where most Australians live. I have many friends in Sydney but you may still find a part of me living close by because at some point in time my first husband decided that he wanted to leave her because they had not been able to go on their honeymoon in such great places so he left me and went to Ireland where it was cold much less beautiful. This is where he found work where it paid him his way. After a while I lost track of the guy until one day my ex-husband called and told me that he was coming back home because he had fallen in love with my daughter who he thought was just like him but she wasn't really like him so he stayed married too. It is not much of a surprise that this would happen because when I moved to Australia for work two months after he left her for work where they worked in Canada as part time teachers and both his parents were from a town called Dingle in County Cork on Ireland which was actually very beautiful except it doesn't have such a nice coastline. These days my father works almost a sixth century job at the library while I live by myself doing something called "web crawling" where you just type an address into your browser and then write about what there is to see and tell visitors about. In this case it is mostly about food because they are a foodie as can be seen in these pictures but for me it gives me a very good insight about the place I have chosen now that I live in Australia. It also helps keep me busy all afternoon when I am taking photos or making videos from around town just waiting for your attention because you see something and wonder if what you are seeing is really what that area of town really looks like and whether all those stories about places being very beautiful actually happened? This is why we want to explore the unknown parts of this world so that no one else feels the same way after having taken advantage of our time on Earth. I guess some people take their life for granted but others think they can only leave or die one death instead or get sick and then not have anything left but me since I do like everything that is around me. We are all trying to find something so let us live our lives and enjoy them for the most part because if we give away everything that matters in life then what would it be then? Where does this make sense? There is no answer yet as far I am concerned but I guess after reading more on it things will start making sense when someone else gets a turn at thinking about these same concepts.

create short stories using this word list each one must have an interesting twist and end differently: "endings", "dreams", "life", "future", "happiness", "joy". The beginning sentence has to contain an interesting twist like a dream, fantasy, something not realistic
Write some fun ideas on which you would build if you did not come from a particular continent but were going to move to the next one? You could write about yourself creating a whole new species from animals, or inventing a very magical country without any history behind it! Then how you will survive in this strange new world without knowing anything of its people, customs, language, food, traditions and culture? What is the best part and how can something like that turn out to be good for society? And then do some more stuff on your imagination if you need more than one word. You never know when these kind of thoughts might come in handy!
Create 200 sentences following this format: Word+ Verb(verb)+ Adjective+Verb+ Object+Noun. Each sentence should have at least 3 different words, use as many free words as possible, and only include vocabulary related to this page or the given questions from this word list. Do not count these words for your total score! You can only be limited by your imagination, you don't even need to come up with a story +10 out of 5 if you follow the guidelines.
  • 10
  • animal
  • 2
  • age(verb)+ adj(adj)
Create 200 sentences of any length following this format: Subject+Verb+(Adjective)+Object1 - 10 points.
Choose some adjectives that make you sad and write as many sentences using these words as possible. Your sentences may be about the way you behave when you're sad, your day or something else. Do not use the words "like". For example: "I hate it when I have to do homework in the living room". Or "She is always tired after her soccer practice".
Use the following five words: (noun1, noun2) + verb + adjective + noun3.
Each sentence should have at least 3 different things going on and use as many adjectives of its own as you can manage! You may or may not use nouns from this page; if you do please don't say the same thing twice, if you do say the same thing twice then lose up to one point for each occurrence. For example:
  • I love my teacher because he/she is a really nice guy; they have good advice and like me. (noun1) + verb (love)+ adjective(nice)+verb (have ) + noun3 ("good advice" or "like me")
Create 200 sentences of any length with this same format as above but use different nouns from these pages: (object1, objective2) + verb + adjective + noun3.
For example: (object1) = you (verb = read), (objective2)= books, (noun1)= I, (noun2)= nice book, (object3) = reading, (noun4)= favorite
To make these sentences really long and interesting, use all the nouns from this page for every adjective in your sentence. This means that you will never say "my house is good", because in this case it has no value on any page so there should be nothing to say about it.
create some funny sentences starting with the word 'I' and end with my favorite noun from a page of 20 words of descriptive titles. (ex) : I love my shoes! My favorite is blue! This one works. My socks ... etc
