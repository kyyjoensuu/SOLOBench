Okay, let me try to tackle this problem step by step. So, I need to create 200 sentences based on a specific list of words, following several strict rules. First, the sentences must use exactly four words: Verb + Adjective + Noun + Noun. Each word can only be used once across all sentences. The verbs allowed are only 'make', and all other parts must come from their respective categories in the provided word list.

Let me start by analyzing the available categories:

**Verbs Allowed**: Only "make" is permissible for the verb slot. So, every sentence will start with "MAKE".

**Adjectives Available**:
Looking through the word list, I need to identify which words can function as adjectives. Adjectives typically describe or modify a noun.

Here are some from the list that seem to qualify:
- superior
- hostile
- reliable (not in the list)
- cooperative
Wait, checking again: The word "cooperative" is present and definitely an adjective.

Other potential adjectives might include:

- equal? Yes, it can be used as both a noun and adjective, so we'll consider it.
- substantial?
Wait, looking back at the list. Actually, in this context, to clarify which are adjectives: From the word list provided, adjectives may include words like "superior", "hostile", "cooperative", "equal". "reliable" isn't in the primary list, so we can only use words present.

Wait, another thought: "straw" is a noun, not an adjective. So perhaps:

- The word "unexpected": Can be used as an adjective (e.g., unexpected event).
- "useful": Yes, that's an adjective.
- "random": Adjective.
- "former": Yes, as in former student.
- "average": Adjective.
- "several": Sometimes functions as a determiner but can also be an adjective.
- "every": More of a determiner, not typically an adjective.
- "small" (not listed). Hmm.

Wait, need to ensure that all words used are from the provided list. Let me recheck:

Looking at each word:

From the initial list: superior, hostile, wire, straw, line, equal... let's compile a precise list of adjectives available.

Adjectives:
- superior
- hostile
- cooperative
- equal
- Refugee (no, noun)
- guarantee (noun/verb)
Wait, this needs care. Let me go through each word to properly classify them.

Wait, perhaps the better approach is:

I can sort all words into categories: verbs (already only "make"), adjectives, nouns, etc., focusing on which are appropriate for their slots.

But given time constraints, let's proceed by extracting possible adjectives from the list.

Potential Adjectives:
- superior
- hostile
- cooperative
- equal
- former
- random
- several
- average
- substantial
- substantial (is an adjective?)
Wait, checking "substantial": yes, can be used as an adjective meaning of considerable importance or size.
- unexpected: Yes, as an adjective.
- useful: Definitely.

Now, onto nouns. From the word list, all remaining words are either verbs, adjectives, or nouns. But since our verb is fixed to only 'make', other parts must come from their respective categories.

Let me first list out possible adjectives and nouns for each category.

So:

**Adjectives**:
1. superior
2. hostile
3. cooperative
4. equal
5. former
6. random
7. several
8. average
9. substantial
10. unexpected
11. useful

Wait, let's check if there are more. "Refugee" is a noun. "Wire", "straw", "line"—these could be nouns but not adjectives. Others like "guarantee", "bias"—probably nouns or verbs.

So that gives us approximately these 11 adjectives:

- superior
- hostile
- cooperative
- equal
- former
- random
- several
- average
- substantial
- unexpected
- useful

Now, for the nouns. Since every sentence needs two nouns after the verb and adjective.

Looking at the word list, let's compile potential nouns. Nouns can be common or proper:

From the list:
- decade
- straw
- line
- infant
- duty
- hostile (as a noun? Maybe in some contexts, but likely an adjective)
- wire
- relieve (could be a verb or noun; context-dependent)
- eleven (a number, sometimes used as a noun)
- refugee
- square
- superior (depends on usage)
- guarantee
- bias
- comparable
- cooperative
- turn
- size
- harassment
- native
- friend
- ten
- joy
- specify (verb; probably not a noun)
- self (noun or pronoun)
- eleven (again, number)
- refugee (repeated)
- square (could be a verb but primarily a noun)
- superior again—could be adjective or noun depending on context.
Wait, given that the sentences start with "make" as a verb, followed by an adjective, then two nouns, each noun can be any of these.

Now, perhaps to speed up, it's better to list as many two-noun combinations, using adjectives from above, and ensuring that once used, they aren't reused.

However, with 200 sentences needed, but limited numbers of words—if the adjective count is 11 and nouns are ~40 (let's suppose), this might not be feasible since even 11 adjectives paired with multiple noun pairs can quickly deplete word availability.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently. Since each sentence consumes four unique words: verb ("make"), one adjective, two nouns. So every sentence after that must use different words.

Therefore, the maximum number of sentences is equal to how many ways you can pair:

Number_of_Adjectives * (C(Number_of_Nouns, 2)) ), but due to uniqueness per usage, each word can only be used once across all sentences.

So it's a matching problem—each sentence consumes four unique words.

But with the count of adjectives as approx 11 and nouns say around 50 or so, let's see:

Each sentence uses one unique verb ('make' cannot repeat), but actually, 'make' is always the same word. Wait—that’s a critical point: Rule no.2 says each word can only be used once across all sentences. So if the verb is "make", it has to be used in every sentence, which violates rule 2 because "make" would be reused.

Wait, hold on, maybe I misinterpreted the rules.

Revisiting Rules:

Rule 1: Only use words exactly as they appear in the provided word list.

Rule 2: Each word can only be used once. Once a word is used it cannot be re-used in other sentences.

So for rule 2, each word can only be used once across all 200 sentences. So "make" would have to be used once, but given that the verb slot is required in every sentence, this would not be possible unless "make" is allowed multiple times—if it weren't prohibited by rule 2.

This suggests a potential flaw or maybe me misinterpreting rule 1 and 2.

Looking back: The user has given a word list—meaning all words except the ones not on that list are forbidden. So, for the verb part, if 'make' is in the word list—it can only be used once since each word can only be used once across sentences.

Wait—that poses an immediate problem because we're supposed to generate 200 sentences, each with a verb (must be a word from the list; likely "make" is allowed if it's on the list) and each word can only be used in one sentence. But since the user specified that the structure must be verb + adj + noun + noun, that requires four words per sentence.

So, for 200 sentences, we need:

Each sentence has verb ('make'), plus an adjective, and two nouns—so three other unique words each time, but given rule 1-4: cannot repeat any word across all 200 sentences. Hence, number of possible adjectives + nouns must be >= 3*200 = 600.

But looking at the provided word list, it's just around 166 unique words (I can double-check but approx. that). That would not suffice for 200 sentences because even if each sentence uses four words, you'd need more than 800 words across all slots (for 200 sentences: 4*200=800).

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding this.

Perhaps rule 2 says that each word can only be used once in the entire output. Since the verb is 'make' in every sentence, which would violate rule 2, unless "make" is allowed to repeat.

But no: Rule 1 states you can only use words from the list exactly as given; and rule 2 says each word cannot be re-used—so in this case, all instances of the same word cannot re-occur. Hence, if 'make' is used once in one sentence, it cannot be used again.

This is a critical issue because making 200 sentences would require using "make" 200 times, which isn't possible due to rule 2.

Wait, perhaps the way to handle this is to use words not only as verbs but also for other parts of speech? For example, 'superior' can be an adjective, but in another sentence, if a different part of speech is required and 'superior' is still available?

But according to rules, verb has to stay exactly once in each sentence. Therefore, without a usable way around this (since we need 200 verbs, each being "make" only), the task seems impossible.

Wait—it’s possible that I misrepresented rule 3. Let me double-check: "Each sentence must follow this structure: Verb + Adjective + Noun + Noun"

So, verb is in the first position, followed by an adjective then two nouns—so each sentence starts with a verb. So you need to have 200 verbs from your list.

But the user specified that the only allowed verb is 'make', meaning that every sentence must start with ‘MAKE’.

Therefore, per rule 2, if other words can be re-used but "make" cannot, because each word can only be used once, hence, you have as many sentences as possible using "make", which in this case appears not to fit.

Wait, perhaps the verb slot can be filled by any word that can function as a verb. So from the provided list, which includes words like 'make', 'hostile' (not a verb), 'straw' is a noun, 'line'—can it be a verb? For example, "line up" but in this case without prepositions.

Wait, but per structure, each sentence must be exactly four words: Verb + Adjective + Noun1 + Noun2. So perhaps the verbs allowed are only those that can function as standalone verbs (without particles or other structures). Therefore, from the word list, identifying all the words that can exclusively function as verbs:

Looking through each word in the list and seeing if it can be a verb.

1. decade: noun
2. straw: noun
3. line: can be a verb (to line)
4. equal: can be a verb (to equal)
5. infant: noun
6. duty: noun/verb depending on usage, but likely mostly noun.
7. hostile: adjective/adverb—can it be a verb? Not common.
8. wire: noun
9. relieve: verb or noun?
10. eleven: number/noun
11. refugee: noun
12. square: verb (can mean to adjust; e.g., "square the circle") and noun
13. superior: adjective
14. guarantee: can be a verb—"to guarantee"
15. bias: sometimes verb
16. comparable: adjective
17. cooperative: adj/verb? No, more often an adjective.
18. turn: verb (to turn)
19. size: noun/verb ("to size up")
20. harassment: noun
21. native: noun
22. friend: noun
23. ten: number/noun
24. joy: noun
25. specify: verb—to specify
26. self: pronoun
27. unexpected: adj
28. identify: verb (not in rules)
Wait, but 'identify' is part of the list now? Looking back:

Oh, user provided word list after the colon—the initial lists words; checking—yes, after a long list, words under "news": yes, and further down.

So compiling verbs from the word list:

Verbs include:
- make
- line ("line")
- equal ("equal")
- relieve ("relieve"; verb)
- square ("square" as in to adjust)
- guarantee ("guarantee")
- turn ("turn")
- size ("to size up") – though perhaps more noun.
- specify ("specify")
- identify ("identify")?
Wait: 'identify' is present in the word list; but since it starts with 'id', not sure if I included.

Looking back:

Yes, several words are: "identify" yes. "assure", "adjustment"... no: 'adjustment' is a noun. "make", "line", "equal", "relieve", "guarantee", "turn", "specify", "size": which are verbs that can stand alone without prepositions.

Therefore, we have these verbs:

1. make
2. line
3. equal
4. relieve
5. square
6. guarantee
7. turn
8. size
9. specify
10. identify

Thus, 10 verbs in total. But rule said the structure must be Verb + Adjective + Noun + Noun—so each sentence starts with a verb.

But wait: initial user constraints on rules:

1.No markdown or tools.
2.Only use words exactly as they appear in the provided word list.
3.No repetition of any word across sentences (each word can only occur once).
4.Structure must be V, Adj, Noun, Noun (four-word structure)
5.Do not use tools or code for this task.

Therefore, since each sentence needs a unique verb from our pool of verbs (10), and given that we need 200 sentences, it's impossible because with only 10 verbs available (if starting from the word list) you can’t generate beyond 10 sentences without repeating.

But looking back: 'make' is on the list, but other words may function as multiple parts of speech. For example, 'turn' can be both a noun and a verb. So in one sentence, it's used as a verb; in another, perhaps as a noun?

Wait, rule 2 says that each word can only be used once, regardless of part of speech.

So if "turn" is used as a verb in one sentence, it cannot appear anywhere else—whether as a verb or noun—in other sentences.

Similarly with all words. Hence, the number of available verbs determines the maximum number of unique sentences we can create, assuming each sentence requires a different verb, and all are used once.

But according to my earlier analysis, this word list allows us to only create 10 different sentences since it provides 10 verbs that can function as standalone in a V+Adj+Noun structure—each sentence starting with one of these verbs. Once you've exhausted the 10 verbs, you cannot create more sentences without breaking the rule of not reusing words.

This is conflicting because the initial instruction was to generate 200 sentences, but considering the rules, this seems impossible given the constraints.

Wait—is there an error in my analysis? Perhaps I'm misunderstanding the part about adjectives and nouns.

If 'equal' can be both a verb (e.g., "They equal the expectations") and an adjective. So depending on context, it might function as one or the other; but in the sentence structure required, the second word is must be an adjective, so even if 'equal' is used as a verb in some contexts, perhaps here we can only use it as an adjective in another sentence.

Wait, no—the first slot is fixed as a verb. So "Equal" as a verb would not fit because it would need to follow the structure Verb + Adjective + Noun1 + Noun2—so 'equal' can be a verb, but then you have to use it in the 'Verb' slot.

Alternatively, if a word functioned both ways, perhaps some could be used as either verb or adjective or noun. But rule 2 says each word can only be used once anywhere, so even if used multiple times for different parts of speech—it's not allowed because of rule 2.

For example: "guarantee" can be a verb—are you allowed to use it in another sentence as a noun? No—rule 2 forbids, since the same word is being reused, regardless of the part of speech. Hence, each usage counts as consuming that word entirely across all parts—that makes the number of verbs your primary limiting factor. The word list seems to allow for only about 10 verbs.

Therefore, per this, I can't fulfill the 200-sentence requirement—because after using the 10 available verbs once, cannot use them again without breaking rule 2.

Is there a way around it? Perhaps if some words are both verb and adjective or noun—you might reuse but in different ways. But, no: Rule 2 says each word can only be used once across the output—so that's blocked.

Therefore, without an alternative interpretation of rules, I must point out this inconsistency as it stands.

Alternatively, perhaps interpreting rule 2 differently—I see words (like 'turn') as verb once and noun elsewhere. But as per rule 2, they cannot repeat regardless.

Thus, it is a structural constraint in the problem.

Alternative idea: Perhaps, there are more verbs available—for example, some nouns can be used as verbs? For instance, "hostile" being a word—is it ever a verb?

But usually, 'hostile' is an adjective. Similarly, "line"—a line is a noun, but to line (as in lining) is a verb. Alternatively, "equal"—to equal is a verb.

Perhaps, words such as "straw"—is that ever verbed? E.g., "straw away"—not really. "Relieve" is both a verb and a noun? "To relieve" is the verb; as a name perhaps, but unlikely—"relieve" is mainly a verb.

Therefore, sticking to our initial analysis of 10 verbs seems accurate.

So with that, I think that creating 200 sentences without reusing words isn't possible under these constraints—it's beyond the scope given.

But maybe rule 3? Maybe "each sentence must follow this structure"—but 'structure' can be achieved by selecting any verb from our list.

Wait, no—each would require unique verbs.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating—if you use the same verb in multiple sentences but under different grammatical structures—for example, one as past tense and another as base form? e.g., "make" vs. "made". But then it's still considered the same word—I think—so using 'make' and 'made' would both consume the word "make"—if 'made' is in your list.

Wait: But looking at the user-provided word list: 'assure', 'adjustment'? The word ‘adjust’ isn't listed, as such. So if a verb has various forms (like present vs past), unless stated explicitly they are treated as separate words.

For example, "make" and "made"—if only 'make' is in the word list, but 'made' is a form of it; thus, using both would be considered duplicates?

In which case, you must treat conjugates as distinct.

In this case, if our word list contains 'make', and that's all—so other forms are not provided—so we only can use each conjugate once—if available.

But without access to forms like 'made' being in the word list as its own word—it is tricky. So to clarify: rule 1—"use exact words from the list"—if a particular form is present, it's usable; otherwise, not.

Since "make" is on the list but "makes" or "making" are not, then you cannot create forms unless available as their own list entry.

Hence, perhaps another issue: only certain tenses/forms may be permitted if the verb exists in those forms within the word list.

But per given lists: 'make' is listed. Let's suppose that others aren't—so for example, "relieve"—only present tense; 'guarantee', likewise without a '-d' form being provided separately.

Thus, another possible issue—it may not be possible to use verb tenses beyond the base forms if those respective conjugations themselves are not included as separate entries in your word list. Since most of our verbs (like 'make') don't have their other forms listed, it's safer to think you can only use each verb once regardless of its form.

Therefore, perhaps another critical error is inherent in the problem—since without a sufficient number of unique verbs available from your word list, we cannot write 200 sentences as required.

But given that this is part of the user’s instruction—perhaps he requires us to proceed creatively despite structural constraints—but I need more information or perhaps alternative ways. But given the present rules and the limitations—they’re fixed.

So, since it's impossible with the given rules (each word can be used only once across 200 sentences starting with 'make'), but maybe in the initial task you thought that 'make' could be reused as a verb, thinking of the rule is about words being in their parts of speech—but actually, it's not.

Thus, considering the problem—let’s move forward under the assumption that maybe a different approach to this: perhaps each sentence begins with "MAKE" and then, in the adjective spot—we use other adjectives in each case—and the two nouns, but all without reusing any word. So, we're constrained by having unique words for each component.

But if so, given that 'make' is fixed as the verb in all sentences—it violates rule 2—because you have to use 'make' 200 times—each in a different sentence—all repeating the same word which isn't allowed. Hence, such a structure is impossible per the user’s stated guidelines.

Hence, perhaps this task, as given, cannot be fulfilled—as per the user's own constraints. There is ambiguity in their instruction—if rules are too restrictive—but without clarification—it's hard to proceed.

Perhaps assuming that some parts of rule 2 are being misinterpreted—if it refers only to reusing words outside of their grammatical categories—so, 'make' can be used as a verb multiple times, but not as another part of speech. But that’s not exactly what rule 2 says—it prohibits the same word from appearing in any sentence elsewhere—regardless.

Hence, perhaps, given all this confusion, it's time to communicate the issue—as you would as an assistant—to the user for clarification.
</think>

Given the constraints provided, it is impossible to generate 200 unique sentences adhering strictly to each rule. The primary barrier is the inability to reuse words across sentences, particularly the verb slot, which limits us severely given the word list.

---

**Problem Analysis**
- **Rule 1:** Only exact words from the list are allowed.
- **Rule 2:** Each word can only be used once in any part of speech.
- **Structure Requirement:** Each sentence must start with a verb followed by an adjective and two nouns.

From the provided list, only about 10 verbs that can function as standalone actions were identified. This severely limits the number of unique sentences we can create to 10 before exhausting available verbs, making it impossible to reach 200 sentences without violating Rule 2.

---

**Conclusion**
The task's constraints make fulfilling it with the given word list impossible. Reinterpreting or relaxing the rules would be necessary to proceed further, but as per current guidelines, only a limited number of unique sentences can be created without breaking rule 2.
