If you are having trouble creating good sentences, consider the following: 
1. Use the words you know. The less you know, the harder it will be to think of words.
2. Keep sentences relatively short. They can be more than 4 words but not more than 6.
3. For words you do not know, try looking them up in a dictionary. The dictionary is helpful but also can be counterproductive because there is so much to learn. 
4. Find words from which sentences are easy to write.
