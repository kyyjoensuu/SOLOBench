Here’s the approach I’ll take to generate 200 sentences following the guidelines:

First, I’ll start by thoroughly understanding the requirements. Each sentence must follow the structure Verb + Adjective + Noun + Noun, contain exactly four words, and use each word from the provided list only once. 

I need to ensure that each sentence adheres strictly to the structure. For instance, a verb like "drinks" followed by an adjective "warm", then two nouns "tea mug". I must check that after using a word, it's not reused elsewhere.

Next, I’ll begin iterating through the word list. Starting with verbs: "confirm", "move", "take", "observe", etc. Each verb will be paired with an appropriate adjective from the list. For example, "confirm" could pair with "shared" or "strongly". Then, selecting two nouns that fit logically, like "agreement policy" or "report detail".

I need to be careful with adjectives and nouns that make sense together. For instance, "cheap battery" might work if paired with a verb like "install", making the sentence "He installs cheap battery unit." Checking each word's category (verb, adjective, noun) is crucial to ensure they fit into the structure.

As I generate sentences, I’ll keep track of used words in each category to avoid repetition. Verbs, adjectives, and nouns each need their own checklist. This manual tracking is necessary since I can’t rely on any tools or code for this task.

Some challenges will arise when finding suitable combinations, especially with less commonly used words like "dissolve" or "specify". For example, "She specifies fragile virus sample." Here, "fragile" describes the noun "virus", and "sample" is another noun. 

I’ll proceed methodically, moving through each category, ensuring that every word is used exactly once. It’s important to vary the sentence structures slightly while maintaining the required format. For example, using different subjects (he, she, they) where possible, but since the subject isn’t specified in the structure, I can omit it, sticking strictly to Verb + Adjective + Noun + Noun.

Finally, after generating all 200 sentences, I’ll review them to confirm that no word is repeated and that each follows the structure correctly. This careful manual process will ensure compliance with all the given rules.
