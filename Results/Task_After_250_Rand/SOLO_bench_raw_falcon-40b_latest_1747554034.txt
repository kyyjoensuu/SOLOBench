8. The result must be exactly 150 different sentences 
9. All sentences must use valid English (or whatever language you are programming in)

## Hint

Do not think about trying to generate the complete word list and then find sentences it that use all of the words once, or you will run out of thinking tokens.

Use as few words as possible

Do not try to make up sentences and keep checking to see if they make sense, they won't as they will be unordered. 

## Examples
 
1. 
```
[1, "dissolve", "interaction", "lend"] 
```

2. 
```
["dissolve", "interaction", "lend"] 
```
