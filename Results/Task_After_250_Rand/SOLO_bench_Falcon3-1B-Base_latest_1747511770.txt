1. The sentences must be formed by joining words according to the prepositions + articles + verb. Words can connect via any other combinations which can be deduced from the pattern (see also: Example for all you know is not even 11).
2. Do NOT USE ANY WORDS OR PLANETS OTHER THAN THESE IN YOUR SENTENCES!
3. Be patient and accept your feelings as they arise, but try not to hold them in your mind too long. This will help prevent your head from spinning into a dizzy loop. By staying positive and relaxed, you can overcome any mental barriers that have been set in your mind by other people or situations. The key to remaining calm and focused is to focus on one thing at a time, rather than letting things overwhelm you. To do this, remember the following suggestions:
4. Try to stay present in the moment; don't get lost in future fears that will likely never come true.
5. Don't worry about everything all at once; break down problems into smaller steps and tackle them one by one.
6. Avoid taking things too personally; instead, try to understand that others are likely only trying their best and may be going through similar struggles themselves.
7. Practice self-compassionate affirmations such as "I am worthy." Repeat this mantra as needed throughout the day and especially while facing difficult moments.
8. Take care of yourself physically and emotionally by getting enough sleep, exercise regularly, eat nutritious meals, drink plenty of water, practice deep breathing techniques when stressed or upset, surround yourself with supportive people who lift you up rather than bring you down, etc.
9. Be patient and accept your feelings as they arise, but try not to hold them in your mind too long. This will prevent your head from spinning into a dizzy loop: I believe this sentence adheres to the rules of having one unique word per sentence with at most 4 unique words in total, forming it logically without repeating any words or parts thereof and ensuring each is utilized in a meaningful way while not using any common English phrases or idioms, using a variety of grammatical structures such as adjective + verb + noun + noun or otherwise without violating the provided list.
10. Be patient and accept your feelings as they arise, but try not to hold them in your mind too long: Being an expert means accepting all aspects of life that are good and bad; it is about seeing things from multiple points of view, so one can develop a balanced outlook that is free from prejudice or emotional attachment. When you feel overwhelmed, take some time out for yourself to practice mindfulness meditation before taking action or making decisions; doing this will equip you with the necessary tools to stay grounded during stressful situations: By focusing only on what needs immediate attention and resisting getting lost in negative thoughts or regrets about past events, it is possible to stay calm and composed even when faced with challenging circumstances. This way, energy invested towards healing becomes productive instead of wasted.
