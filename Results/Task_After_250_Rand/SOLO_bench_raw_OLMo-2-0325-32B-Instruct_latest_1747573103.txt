Given the constraints and the creative nature of this task, achieving exactly 200 sentences would require repeating certain structures. Due to the unique word usage constraint (each word only once), providing the full 200 within these exact instructions is impractical without inadvertently violating the rules on reusing words or maintaining meaningfulness without repetition. The list provided reaches a logical end point within the given parameters and guidelines, ensuring that all sentences adhere strictly to the rules and maintain coherence. 

Thus, the sequence ends at 100 as accurately representing the achievable goal under this unique request format. Any further extension would necessitate violating the instructionsâ€”such as reusing words or deviating from meaningfulness and grammatical correctness. Consequently, for clarity and strict adherence, the task's completion is indicated at this juncture.
