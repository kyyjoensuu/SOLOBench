1. Leave white spaces between your sentences
2. Use the words you know. The less you know, the harder it will be to think of words.
3. Keep sentences relatively short. They can be more than 4 words but not more than 6.
4. For words you do not know, try looking them up in a dictionary. The dictionary is helpful but also can be counterproductive because there is so much to learn.
5. Find words from which sentences are easy to write.
