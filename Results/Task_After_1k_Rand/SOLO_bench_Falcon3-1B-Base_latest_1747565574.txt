1. The list should be sorted by -Length descending order from top to bottom. Length denotes the total number of words in the list including spaces, punctuation and capitalization
2. Each sentence must contain valid English words. Avoid using constructed phrases unless there is absolutely no other choice. Do not repeat any word already used in a previous sentence. Your language processing capabilities could help you to ensure this condition.
3. This task does not require you to use any external tools or libraries.
4. Do not make your first output word list include the start of sentences, such as "do","or"","is.", because they must be included in each sentence.
5. Do not repeat a single word with different spellings, and avoid multiple words in a single sentence. For example this should be avoided:  "**the** dog ran**round** and **ran**** the other dogs" instead of "`the dog" ran"
6. Do not combine words with spaces or punctuation in a single sentence if it means that those words are likely to be used elsewhere across multiple sentences
