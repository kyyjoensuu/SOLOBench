1. Your responses can only contain English sentences without any modification or alterations. They do not need to be written by humans.
2. Do not use contractions, do not use abbreviations, and avoid excessive punctuation. For example: instead of "They're Going To Have A Baby", write just "They are going to have a baby". The words in between should be proper nouns. For example: if the input is the word "Apple", your output should also be "Apples".
3. Make sure that every sentence has a verb in it.
