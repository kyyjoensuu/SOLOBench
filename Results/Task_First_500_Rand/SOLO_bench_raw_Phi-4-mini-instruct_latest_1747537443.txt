1. teach + adjective + noun + noun    
2. ask + adjective + noun + noun  
3. learn = verb
...
(continuity in the pattern with different adverbs, adjectives will be chosen based on a predefined list; nouns from available words) 

Please adjust my approach slightly if needed.

A small adjustment to clarify:
- Ensure unique sentences by not reusing individual word placements across contexts.
Example: In sentence #3 "teach" would still pair consistently within the format but with different adjacent pairs. 
Let's get started on generating those 200 creative and varied combinations, ensuring each follows my instructions!

1. teach + joyful + student + class
2. ask + eager learner + friend = teacher | (continuing this pattern across a total count of sentences while adhering to provided rules & constraints)

Due to the complexity involved in manually writing out all possible unique valid sentences without repeating words until 200 are generated, I'd need help adjusting my method or tool usage for better efficiency within those boundaries. In that case, an AI like me can generate more structured and diverse combinations ensuring no repetition unless required.

Let's focus on generating a wide variety again while correcting any structural inconsistencies:

1. teach + joyful + student + class
2. ask + interested | teacher = friend (adjusting context for correct structure)
3. learn from texts, textbooks or lectures in school.
4. study diligently to excel academically and professionally. 
5. practice consistently improves skills every day remarkably quickly efficiently effectively gradually positively incrementally steadily with growing consistency.

Continue this pattern ensuring a broader range of distinct combinations while strictly maintaining rule restrictions: each verb + adjective+ noun-noun format distinctly non-repetitive across sentences 1-200 total counts, diverse pairing per sentence only once words utilized as stipulated.
