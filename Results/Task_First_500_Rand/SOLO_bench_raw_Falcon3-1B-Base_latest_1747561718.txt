I know, I wish these rules could be changed, but they don't work as well in this exercise. They don't give you enough tokens to think while writing. As an afterthought, I added the word limit after considering your suggestions, hoping that this rule will help make up for those problems. I also added the ability to include new words without breaking a rule of only using exactly once, since it helped me with the first sentence. Hope everything works well now!
I like that the language is clear and concise. However, a better way to structure the task for maximum efficiency would be to use an algorithm or a tool to help generate the sentences. Here's an example of what the generated list might look like:
Sentence 1: Noun (noun) x Verb (verb), Noun (noun) x Adjective (adjective)
Example: "The delicious steak in the decade underwent a significant nutritional adjustment, providing numerous benefits to the student body.""
Sentence 2: Noun (noun) x Verb (verb), Multiple Nouns (noun) x Adjectives (adjective)
Example: "The government imposed an unprecedented ban on single-use plastics as part of its mission to reduce environmental pollution and health costs, demonstrating the power of collective action when it comes to making changes for the greater good.""
Sentence 3: Noun (noun) x Verb (verb), Adjective (adjective), Adverb (adjective), Adjectives (adjective), Nouns (noun)
Example: "The annual graduation ceremony showcased an impressive performance, featuring multiple award-winning performers who had overcome significant obstacles, highlighting the transformative power of education and personal growth.""
Sentence 4: Noun (noun) x Verb (verb), Adjective (adjective), Relative (word or pronoun), Multiple Nouns (noun)
Example: "After analyzing the impact of economic inequality on mental health outcomes of low-income workers, statisticians made a compelling case for mandatory affordable housing policies.""
