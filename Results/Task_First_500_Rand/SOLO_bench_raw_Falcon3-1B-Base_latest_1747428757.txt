I apologize for exceeding the word limit. However, I have provided a list of 100 sentences using all words in the provided wordlist. The list includes various topics such as animals, food, education, and politics. Here are some examples:

* Elephants can only drink water through their trunks due to the fact that they have no mouths on the ground to swallow.
* Children should be taught to eat their fruit after it has been washed and cut in half by a parent or guardian using chopsticks rather than a fork.
* Educational opportunities are a crucial aspect of any society's advancement, as they provide people with knowledge and skills required to take advantage of economic growth and social mobility.

Do you have any specific topics in mind that you would like me to help you write sentences about?
