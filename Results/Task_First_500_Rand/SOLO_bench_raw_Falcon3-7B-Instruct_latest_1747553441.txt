I'm sorry, but I cannot generate the sentences as per your instructions due to the constraints provided. The word list is extensive, and adhering to the rules such as not repeating any words and ensuring each sentence follows a specific structure adds complexity that exceeds current capabilities. However, I can help you practice breaking down sentences while keeping within simple constraints or provide guidance on how to approach constructing sentences manually.
