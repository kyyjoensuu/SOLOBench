In English grammar, the word ‘every’ can be defined in a variety of ways to indicate quantity or to show something occurring repeatedly. It’s essentially used for counting how often an action occurs or to say that every item among many has something specific.

‘Every’ usually works as:

1. Pronoun — Every is considered a pronoun when it substitutes the noun of a sentence, e.g., “Every one of them got there on time.” Here, ‘every’ serves as a pronoun that stands instead of the noun (people) used before.
2. Adjective — When every modifies the noun or tells more about it by specifying how many times something happens or that some actions apply to all things at hand.

### The Grammatically Correct Use of ‘Every’

1. When used as an adjective:

   - **Singular with singular noun:**
     This form usually precedes a singular countable noun, indicating one in every group of items.

     Examples:
       1. Every child came here.
       2. Every person needs food and water.
       3. She read every book in the library.

         (Note: In all instances, the noun following ‘every’ is singular.)

   - **Every plus plural meaning:**
     Occasionally, it can precede an implied or understood plural noun:

     Example:
       1. Every one of the students was there.
          Here, though “one” is singular and immediately precedes a plural noun, you understand that “the students” are collectively counted.

2. When used as an adverb:

   It indicates repeated action at regular intervals or every unit of time/space:

   Example:
      1. He visits his relatives every week.
         (Here it means regularly each week)

3. Every day:

When ‘every’ is combined with the word “day,” it usually forms compounds such as “everyday” which typically describes something usual, regular, and familiar.

Example:
1.  These are my everyday shoes.
2. She wore her everyday clothes to work today — simple and casual

### The Grammatical Errors of ‘Every’

1. **Misuse with Plural Nouns:**
   A common error is using “every” before a plural noun (without the use of intermediary words like “one”) because every requires singular nouns.

Incorrect:
      1. Every students were absent.
Correct:
       2. Every one of the students was absent. or All the students were absent.

2. **Pronoun Errors:**
   Using plural pronouns when preceded by ‘every’ can be incorrect since 'every' usually goes with a singular noun phrase.

Incorrect:

        Everybody should do his best work
      (This is grammatically acceptable as it is not referring specifically to gender, though traditionally “his” has been used. To be more inclusive, you could use "their" instead.)

Correct:
             Everyone/Everybody should do their best work

4.)  **When writing ‘everyday**:
        It should describe something common or ordinary. Avoid the mistake of writing this as two words when you really mean every single day.

Incorrect:

           She goes to the supermarket ev’ery day.
   Correct (for describing regularity):
              She goes to the supermarket everyday (as one word)
         Correct (every individual day separately):
              She goes to the supermarket every day.
