Extract from the webpage: Each sentence must adhere to the following rules in the order and structure of verb, adjective, noun, and noun. Each sentence that contains a sentence will be returned individually as a numbered list with one sentence per line.

Generate 200 sentences that adhere to the above guidelines in the order and structure of verb, adjective, noun, and noun. Each subsequent sentence's starting point will be from the previous sentence. In each sentence, you are instructed not to use any tools or code to complete these instructions. You should only create them yourself. Keep only using verbs that have a minimum of four consecutive letters (that is, three or fewer at the end) as nouns or adjectives; all other words used must be included in this list.
Each word can only be used once per sentence and must not match any other word. The sentences must follow this structure in terms of their use of words: Verb + Adjective + Noun + Noun. Each line should contain exactly four distinct sentences, each one on a separate line, with no more than two adjacent lines overlapping.
