Note:
Each word or letter can only be used once in each sentence.
The first sentence will be the seed word, which you can use to create 200 words using the word bank in the file.
The seed word is <u>only</u> the word “honest”
The resulting 200 sentences must satisfy the following rules:
1. Only use words exactly as they appear in the list below.
2. Each word can only be used once. Once a word is used it cannot be re-used in any other sentence.
3. Each sentence must follow this structure: Verb + Adjective + Noun + Noun
4. Each sentence must contain exactly 4 words
5. Do not use any tools or code to accomplish the task
6. Do not output the entire word bank in your thinking stage, it is too long and you will run out of thinking tokens
7. Return only a numbered list with one sentence on each line.
Note: You have to put it in the correct order.
You can add extra sentences by inserting words in the word bank.
