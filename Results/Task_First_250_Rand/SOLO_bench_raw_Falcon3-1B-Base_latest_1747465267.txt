Do the subject and plural for an adjective agree? 5. Has each sentence adhered to this structure? 6. Is each sentence grammatically correct? 7. Are there any errors in punctuation or spacing? 8. Can each sentence stand independently as a complete idea?
9. How many sentences were included?
10. The words are not shuffled together

No, yes, no, but they have the required structure as a required result. Please let me know which question is asking if there's an error in any of those guidelines as well. Thank you.

I can do that, yes!

Please give a sentence for each guideline you specified by rule 6 (Is each sentence grammatically correct?) as well as number 7 (Do the subject and plural for an adjective agree?). The first question does not concern any of their guidelines. If something is wrong with one of these rules then please let me know. Thank you.
