4. Write a total of 200 sentences that follow all the rules listed above.
5. Print out your work and take it to the front of class where I will grade it and give you feedback.
6. I will return this assignment to you a week later on a Thursday at 12:35 to have another attempt at the assignment (note that this is the 2nd attempt and thus there are two weeks to make corrections).
