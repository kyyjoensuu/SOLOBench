<u><strong>The Task: (Instructions)</strong></u>

This task should test your ability to write and think at speed. Some of the sentences in the task require you to find a verb that goes with a noun and verb that goes with a noun and adjective or verb that goes with a noun and adverb. This is an opportunity to develop your skills as a writer. The task will provide you with a template for writing on certain topics.

Each question in the task has a number. The numbers correspond to the order of the questions you need to answer. The first two numbers refer to the sentence with the verb and the last three numbers refer to the sentence with an adjective or adverb. Remember that the only words you could use in a written or spoken sentence are words and words.

You will have to look for a verb and an adjective/adverb in the sentences and use them. To do this, I wrote a template. The template helps you to write the word. So it will be easier to do than to try to think out of the question.

The sentences will contain words that can be used as nouns, verbs and adjectives/adverbs. For example, "I want a glass of milk."

Use this table to find the verbs.

Use this table to find the nouns.

Use this table to find the adjectives/adverbs.

For each sentence, choose a verb from the template and the noun/adjective, the adjective from the table and the adverbs to match them.

For example, if the first sentence has an adjective/adverb and the noun/noun, the first verb is <i>want</i>. For the second sentence and the first noun/noun verb, the first verb is <i>have</i>. The third sentence has two adjectives/adverb, the first noun comes second, the first verb is <i>want</i>. For the second sentence, the first noun is the second verb, the first verb is <i>see</i>. For the third sentence the first noun is third, the first verb is <i>hear</i>, the second noun is second, the first verb is <i>see</i>.

<b>EXPLANATION</b>
Words that represent a person, animal, or an object are called <b>PERSON INANIMATE WORDS</b>.

<b>VERB INANIMATE WORDS</b> are words that have a <b>VERB WITH NO PERSON</b>.

<b>VERB ANIMATE WORDS</b> are words in the following cases:

<b>INANIMATE VERB</b>, which has no <b>ANIMATE VERB</b> in the example <b>TO SQUIRT = to spray</b>, will always have a <b>VERB TO SQUEAK = to squeak</b>. The reason is because the <b>VERB TO SQUEAK</b> in example <b>TO SQUIRT</b> is an <b>INANIMATE VERB</b>, which does not have a <b>VERB TO SQUEAK</b> in the same example <b>TO SQUEAL = to squeal</b>.

<b>VERB ANIMATE WITH NO ANIMATE VERB IN THE EXAMPLES</b>

Example 1: The dog jumped in the bucket. = The dog jumped to the bucket
→ There is no <b>ANIMATE VERB</b> in the first sentence.
→ We get the sentence: The dog <b>jumped</b> to the bucket.

Example 2: <b>The bird jumped up in the tree.</b> = The bird jumped on the tree.
→ There is no <b>ANIMATE VERB</b> in the first sentence.
→ We get the sentence: The bird <b>jumped</b> on the tree.
