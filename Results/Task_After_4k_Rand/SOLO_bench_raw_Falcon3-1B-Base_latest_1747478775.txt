8. You must start each new sentence with [NEW.] and end each sentence with [STOP]
9. If you get stuck or don't understand what's possible or what you want to do, go back to the beginning of this question and try again
You can copy/paste whole words from this list like so: `['The', 'city, 'New_York', 'has', '"a', 'tall', 'Empire State', 'building']`. BUT NOT this: `[The city has a tall Empire State building]`
Your task is to write a program that will solve this word puzzle for you and outputs only the sentence(s) above.
Example submission:
[NEW.] The city of ‘New York’has a towering blue Empire State building.

Explanation:
- The output sentence(s): 
 * “The city of New York has a tall Empire State Building.”

You have met the rules! You are asked to write code, not generate text or come up with ideas... That is why you should use as few libraries as possible. Try to use standard input/output operations instead of extra library calls. Avoid global variables and try to minimize variables used inside functions as well. Finally, don't change the file path on every line, you should only do that when necessary (e.g. If your program changes the input file path).

You've created a sentence that follows all the rules... Nice job!
